- 2025-03-30T17:48:31: Enhanced certificate email reliability and error handling
  - Improved PDF generation process with robust error handling:
    - Added try/catch blocks around PDF creation and base64 conversion
    - Implemented safety timeout to prevent infinite modal waiting
    - Added file size validation to prevent oversized attachments
  - Enhanced API endpoint `/api/email/send_with_attachment` with:
    - Better input validation for email addresses and attachment data
    - Comprehensive error handling for base64 decoding
    - Specific SMTP error reporting
    - Detailed server-side logging with stack traces
    - Size limits to prevent excessive memory usage
  - Improved user feedback with specific error messages for different failure points

- 2025-03-30T17:42:43: Fixed email sending in certificates module
  - Identified and fixed the root cause of why certificate emails weren't being sent
  - Modified `static/js/certificates.js` to fix asynchronous execution flow problems:
    - Moved modal closing into appropriate callback locations to prevent premature closing
    - Made certificate database save and email sending sequential
    - Ensured modal only closes after operations are complete
  - Added patient email validation to prevent attempts to send to invalid addresses
  - Added more detailed client-side error handling for PDF generation and email sending

  - Added logging to certificate email submission process to track form data and API responses
  - Enhanced regular email information form with diagnostic logging
  - Added server-side logging in `rest.py` for both email endpoints:
    - `api/email/send` - Regular email sending
    - `api/email/send_with_attachment` - PDF attachment email sending
  - All logs capture key data points (recipients, content lengths, attachment details)
  - Improved error logging to help diagnose email delivery issues
  - These logs will help identify why certificate emails aren't sending while regular emails work

- 2025-03-30T11:20:34: Fixed timeoffset calculation in settings-example.py
  - Modified `get_timeoffset()` function to properly handle timezone conversions
  - Added explicit check for None values before calling total_seconds() on utc_offset
  - Implemented robust error handling with fallback to default values
  - Added type annotations and improved docstring
  - Fixed linter error: "total_seconds is not a known attribute of None"

- 2025-03-29T22:58:00: Fixed worklist status update functionality
  - Modified `static/js/useful.js`: Updated `setWlItemStatus` function to remove ID from request payload
    - ID is now correctly passed in the URL instead of the payload
    - Ensures proper validation in py4web's RestAPI
  - Modified `static/js/patient-bar.js`: Fixed status update in patient bar
    - Updated `btnUnlockTask` click handler to use correct API endpoint format
    - Updated `btnTaskDone` click handler to match the same pattern
    - Both buttons now correctly update task status without validation errors
  - Root cause: py4web's RESTful API validation was failing because:
    - ID was being sent both in URL and payload causing validation conflicts
    - Fixed by sending ID only in URL path and removing it from payload
    - Matches py4web's RESTful API expectations for PUT requests
  - Cross-system behavior explanation:
    - The issue worked on another computer likely due to different py4web versions
    - Older versions of py4web (pre-3.0) were more lenient with validation
    - Newer versions enforce stricter RESTful API conventions
    - The fix ensures compatibility with all py4web versions by following best practices

- 2025-03-30T17:15:09.650400: Fixed auth_user validation issue in user management forms
  - Modified `static/js/user.js`: Updated form submission functions to handle ID field correctly
    - Removed ID from payload for all PUT requests in userAuth_userForm submit handler
    - Updated userMd_paramForm submit handler to use ID only in URL
    - Updated userFormSubmit function to prevent sending ID in payload
  - Root cause: Same validation issue as previous fix where ID was being sent in both URL and payload
    - py4web REST API validation was rejecting requests with duplicate IDs
    - Fixed by ensuring ID is only sent in the URL for PUT requests, not in the payload
