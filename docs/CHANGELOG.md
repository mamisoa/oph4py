- 2025-03-29T22:58:00: Fixed worklist status update functionality
  - Modified `static/js/useful.js`: Updated `setWlItemStatus` function to remove ID from request payload
    - ID is now correctly passed in the URL instead of the payload
    - Ensures proper validation in py4web's RestAPI
  - Modified `static/js/patient-bar.js`: Fixed status update in patient bar
    - Updated `btnUnlockTask` click handler to use correct API endpoint format
    - Updated `btnTaskDone` click handler to match the same pattern
    - Both buttons now correctly update task status without validation errors
  - Root cause: py4web's RESTful API validation was failing because:
    - ID was being sent both in URL and payload causing validation conflicts
    - Fixed by sending ID only in URL path and removing it from payload
    - Matches py4web's RESTful API expectations for PUT requests
  - Cross-system behavior explanation:
    - The issue worked on another computer likely due to different py4web versions
    - Older versions of py4web (pre-3.0) were more lenient with validation
    - Newer versions enforce stricter RESTful API conventions
    - The fix ensures compatibility with all py4web versions by following best practices

    - Removed ID from payload for all PUT requests in userAuth_userForm submit handler
    - Updated userMd_paramForm submit handler to use ID only in URL
    - Updated userFormSubmit function to prevent sending ID in payload
  - Root cause: Same validation issue as previous fix where ID was being sent in both URL and payload
    - py4web REST API validation was rejecting requests with duplicate IDs
    - Fixed by ensuring ID is only sent in the URL for PUT requests, not in the payload

- 2025-03-30T20:21:46.219670: Fixed certificate email functionality
  - Fixed issue where email button was triggering print instead of email
  - Updated HTML template to use unique ID for actionType input (certificateActionType)

  - Changed from incorrect `URL('manage', 'user', vars=dict(id=patientId))` to correct `URL('user', patientId)`
  - Fixed 404 error when clicking the Edit Patient button
  - The URL now properly matches the route defined in manage.py with `@action("user/<rec_id>")`
  - Ensures seamless navigation between patient view and user edit screens

- 2025-03-30T20:35:12.219670: Fixed actionType field IDs in prescription modals
  - Updated actionType input ID to `GxRxactionType` in glasses prescription modal (GxRxModal)
  - Updated actionType input ID to `CxRxactionType` in contacts prescription modal (CxRxModal)
  - Modified corresponding JavaScript handlers in glasses.js and contacts.js
  - Ensures consistent and unique IDs across all prescription modals
