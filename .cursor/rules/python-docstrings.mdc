# Python Script Documentation Guidelines (Using Poetry or uv)

1. **Overview & Purpose:**  
   - Describe the script's title, its overall functionality, and its main objectives.  
   - Clearly state the intended purpose and context for using the script.

2. **Table of Contents:**  
   - Provide an organized list of sections for the documentation, such as:  
     - Overview & Purpose  
     - Table of Contents  
     - Installation & Dependencies  
     - Usage Instructions  
     - Code Documentation & Docstrings  
     - Architecture & Design  
     - Testing & Troubleshooting  
     - Versioning, Changelog & Licensing  
     - Additional Resources

3. **Installation & Dependencies:**  
   - **Python Version:** Specify the required Python version (e.g., Python 3.8+).  
   - **Dependency Management:**  
     - Indicate which package manager is used (Poetry or uv) by checking for `poetry.lock` or `uv.lock` files.
     - **For Poetry Projects:**
       - Dependencies are listed in the `pyproject.toml` file.
       - Run `poetry install` to set up the environment.
       - Add new dependencies: `poetry add package_name`
       - Add development dependencies: `poetry add --dev package_name`
     - **For uv Projects:**
       - Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` files.
       - Run `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` to set up the environment.
       - Add new dependencies: Update `requirements.txt` and run `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
       - Add development dependencies: Update `requirements-dev.txt` and run `uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

4. **Usage Instructions:**  
   - Provide clear instructions on how to run the script, including command-line examples.  
   - Include sample inputs and expected outputs to help users understand its usage.
   - Specify any environment activation steps:
     - Poetry: `poetry shell` or `poetry run python script.py`
     - uv: `source .venv/bin/activate` then `python script.py`

5. **Code Documentation & Comprehensive Docstrings:**  
   - **Exhaustive Docstrings (Mandatory for Classes, Methods, and Functions):**  
     - **Purpose Description:** Explain what the class, method, or function does.  
     - **Arguments:** List all parameters, specifying names, types, and brief descriptions.  
     - **Return Value:** Describe the return type and its significance.  
     - **Error Handling:** Document how errors are handled, including exceptions raised and under what conditions.  
     - **Usage Example:** Provide a short example demonstrating how to use the documented element.
   - **Modification Enforcement:**  
     - Ensure that any changes in the code trigger a review and update of the associated docstrings.  
     - During code reviews, verify that all new or modified Python files include accurate and updated docstrings.
   - **Implementation Guidelines:**  
     - Always include a comprehensive docstring when creating a new class, method, or function.  
     - Integrate linters or CI tools to enforce these documentation standards automatically.
   - **Example Docstring:**

     ```python
     def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
         """
         Adds two integers and returns the result.
     
         Args:
             a (int): The first integer.
             b (int): The second integer.
     
         Returns:
             int: The sum of the two integers.
     
         Raises:
             TypeError: If either a or b is not an integer.
     
         Example:
             >>> add(3, 4)
             7
         """
         if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int):
             raise TypeError("Both a and b must be integers")
         return a + b
     ```

6. **Architecture & Design:**  
   - Provide an overview of the code structure and responsibilities of each module or component.  
   - Optionally include flow diagrams or sketches to illustrate how data and logic flow through the script.
   - Document any package manager specific configurations or requirements.

7. **Testing & Troubleshooting:**  
   - Explain how to run tests based on the package manager:
     - Poetry: `poetry run pytest`
     - uv: Activate environment and run `pytest`
   - Provide information on common issues, error messages, and troubleshooting tips.
   - Include package manager specific troubleshooting guidance.

8. **Versioning, Changelog & Licensing:**  
   - **Version Information:** Specify the current version of the script.  
   - **Changelog:** Maintain a log of updates, improvements, and bug fixes.  
   - **Licensing:** State the license under which the script is distributed.  
   - **Contribution Guidelines:** (If applicable) Include instructions for contributing to the project.

9. **Additional Resources:**  
   - Provide links or references to:
     - External documentation
     - Related projects
     - Detailed user guides
     - Package manager documentation (Poetry/uv)
     - Python packaging best practices
