# Markdown Formatting Rule

## Overview
This rule ensures that all generated markdown files by Cursor adhere to proper markdown formatting guidelines. In particular, Cursor must comply with the following markdownlint rules:

- **MD032: Blanks Around Lists**  
  Lists must be preceded and followed by blank lines.

- **MD031: Blanks Around Fences**  
  Fenced code blocks must be preceded and followed by blank lines.

- **MD034: No Bare URLs**  
  Bare URLs should not be used in the markdown. For instance, email addresses or other URLs must be wrapped in angle brackets or formatted using markdown link syntax.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Lists (MD032):**
   - Every list (ordered or unordered) should have at least one blank line above and below it.
   - **Example:**
     ```markdown
     Introduction text.
     
     - List item 1
     - List item 2
     
     Concluding text.
     ```

2. **Fenced Code Blocks (MD031):**
   - Ensure that there is a blank line before and after any fenced code block.
   - **Example:**
     ```markdown
     Some introductory text.
     
     ```python
     def sample_function():
         return "Hello, World!"
     ```
     
     Some following text.
     ```

3. **Bare URLs (MD034):**
   - Avoid using bare URLs in the markdown. Instead, wrap them in angle brackets or use markdown link formatting.
   - **Incorrect Example:**
     ```markdown
     For more details, contact: john.doe@example.com
     ```
   - **Correct Examples:**
     ```markdown
     For more details, contact: <john.doe@example.com>
     ```
     or
     ```markdown
     For more details, contact: [john.doe@example.com](mdc:mailto:john.doe@example.com)
     ```

## Conclusion
By enforcing these markdown formatting rules, Cursor will generate markdown files that are consistent, readable, and compliant with established best practices. These guidelines help maintain high-quality documentation and content standards across all projects.
