## [2025-06-01T21:24:12.693251] - Made Fee Field Editable in Billing Modal

### Changed
- **Fee Field Now Editable in Billing Code Modal**
  - Removed `readonly` attribute from the fee input field in `templates/modalityCtr/md.html`
  - Users can now manually edit the fee amount after selecting a nomenclature code
  - Fee field is pre-populated from nomenclature search but remains editable for custom adjustments
  - Maintains step="0.01" for precise decimal input (cents)

### Technical Details
- **HTML Template**: Removed `readonly` from `#billFee` input field
- **JavaScript Behavior**: Fee value is populated from nomenclature selection but field remains editable
- **User Experience**: Allows fee customization while maintaining automatic population from nomenclature database

## [2025-06-01T21:09:44.309502] - Improved UX by Removing Redundant Alert Messages

### Removed

- **Redundant Bootbox Alerts in Billing Module**
  - Removed `bootbox.alert("Billing code saved successfully!")` from individual code save operation
  - Removed `bootbox.alert("Billing combo applied successfully!")` from combo application operation
  - These were redundant as there are already toast notifications providing the same feedback
  - Streamlined user experience by reducing duplicate success messages

### Technical Details

- **Billing Code Save**: Now only shows toast notification and refreshes table
- **Billing Combo Apply**: Now only shows toast notification, hides modal, and refreshes table
- **Error Handling**: Preserved bootbox alerts for error cases as they are important for user attention
- **UX Improvement**: Reduced notification noise while maintaining essential feedback

## [2025-06-01T21:04:59.182309] - Enhanced Billing Table with Fee Code Display

### Added

- **Fee Code Column in Billing Codes Table**
  - Added feecode column to the main billing codes table (not just search results)
  - Positioned between Fee and Total columns for logical flow
  - Implemented `feecodeFormatter()` function for consistent badge styling
  - Feecode displays as blue info badge when present, dash when null
  - Column is sortable for easy organization

### Technical Details

- **HTML Template**: Added `data-field="feecode"` with `data-formatter="feecodeFormatter"`
- **JavaScript**: Created `feecodeFormatter()` function returning styled badge or placeholder
- **Styling**: Uses Bootstrap `bg-info` badge class for consistent blue theme
- **Data Flow**: Feecode already extracted in `responseHandler_billing()` function

  - Added robust response format detection to handle both FastAPI and py4web formats
  - Enhanced debugging with comprehensive console logging for troubleshooting
  - Verified database records are being saved correctly (worklist 324576 has billing codes)

### Added

- **Enhanced Nomenclature Search Results Display**
  - Added feecode column to nomenclature search results table in billing modal
  - Updated HTML template to include "Fee Code" column header
  - Modified `displayNomenclatureResults()` function to display feecode with info badge styling

## [2025-06-01T20:38:16.020309] - FastAPI Response Format Fix for Nomenclature Search

### Fixed

- **FastAPI Response Handling**: Enhanced nomenclature search to properly handle the external FastAPI service response format

### Technical Improvements

- **Robust DOM Element Access**: Enhanced DOM element detection with multiple fallback strategies
  - Primary strategy: Direct ID search (`#nomenSearchTableBody`, `#nomenSearchResults`)
  - Fallback 1: Search within modal context

  2. Generic data format: `{data: [...]}`
  3. py4web format: `{items: [...], count: ...}`
  4. Direct array response

### Testing Tools

Added new debugging function available in browser console:

- `window.testWithUserProvidedData()` - Tests with exact FastAPI response structure provided by user
- Enhanced logging shows exact data extraction path and success/failure points
- Real-time debugging for DOM element availability and search results display

### Root Cause Resolution

The issue was that the external nomenclature API returns a FastAPI response format with `status: "success"` which requires specific detection logic to differentiate from generic `{data: [...]}` formats. The enhanced extraction logic now prioritizes FastAPI format detection and provides comprehensive fallback mechanisms for robust functionality.

  - Bootstrap table now properly finds event handlers during initialization
  - Event handlers for edit and remove actions in billing table now work correctly
  - Fixed timing issue where table initialization happened before event handlers were available

### Technical Details

- Root cause: Bootstrap table attempts to bind events during initialization, but `operateEvents_billing` was defined inside `$(document).ready()` block
- Solution: Moved event handler definitions to global scope before table initialization
- All billing table functions now properly available: `responseHandler_billing`, `operateFormatter_billing`, `detailFormatter_billing`, `totalFeeFormatter`
- Maintained consistency with other table event handlers in the codebase

## [2025-06-01T19:59:44.297934] - Enhanced Billing Modal with Improved API Integration

### Fixed

- **Nomenclature API Integration**: Fixed billing modal search functionality to properly call nomen.c66.ovh API
  - Corrected API parameters: now uses `code` and `description` instead of incorrect `q` parameter
  - Fixed py4web compatibility: changed `request.vars` to `request.query` for proper parameter handling

### Testing Results

- Verified API endpoint works with code search: `?code=105755` returns proper nomenclature data
- Verified API endpoint works with description search: `?description=consultation` returns relevant results
- Confirmed modal integration maintains existing functionality while adding improved search capabilities

## [2025-06-01T19:50:52.691695] - Phase 3 Post-Implementation Fix

### Fixed
