## [2025-06-08T03:21:45.548685] - Dashboard Charts PyDAL Date Function Fix

### Fixed

- **PyDAL Date Function Error**: Resolved `AttributeError: 'Field' object has no attribute 'date'` in chart data API
  - **Root Cause**: Used `.date()` method on pyDAL Field objects which is not supported in pyDAL syntax
  - **Original Code**: `db.auth_user.created_on.date().with_alias("date")` (invalid pyDAL syntax)
  - **Solution**: Replaced database-level date grouping with Python-level date grouping for better compatibility
  - **Performance**: Moved from SQL GROUP BY to Python collections.defaultdict for date aggregation

### Changed

- **Chart Data Processing**: Enhanced `chart_data()` function in `controllers.py` with database-agnostic approach
  - **Before**: Database-level grouping using unsupported `.date()` method with SQL GROUP BY
  - **After**: Python-level grouping using `collections.defaultdict` and Python's `datetime.date()` method
  - **Query Simplification**: Removed complex GROUP BY queries, now uses simple SELECT with ORDER BY
  - **Date Extraction**: Uses Python `row.created_on.date()` instead of SQL date functions

### Technical Details

- **Database Compatibility**: Solution now works across all database backends (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Python Date Grouping**: Uses `defaultdict(int)` to count occurrences by date
- **Sorting**: Maintains chronological order using `sorted(date_counts.keys())`
- **Error Handling**: Added null checking for `created_on` fields
- **Performance**: Efficient Python grouping with minimal database queries

**Chart Data Flow**:

1. Query all records within date range (no GROUP BY)
2. Group by date in Python using `collections.defaultdict`
3. Sort dates chronologically
4. Format for Chart.js consumption

**Files Modified**:

- `controllers.py` - Fixed chart_data() function with Python-based date grouping

**Impact**: Chart data API now works reliably across all database backends without SQL date function dependencies

## [2025-06-08T03:19:16.609200] - Dashboard Charts Template Variable Fix

### Fixed

- **Template Variable Error**: Resolved `NameError: name 'HOSTURL' is not defined` in dashboard template
  - **Root Cause**: `index()` controller was not passing `hosturl` variable to template context
  - **Secondary Issue**: Template was using uppercase `HOSTURL` instead of lowercase `hosturl` variable name
  - **Solution**: Added `hosturl = LOCAL_URL` to index controller and corrected template variable name
  - **Pattern Consistency**: Now follows same pattern as payment_view and daily_transactions controllers

### Changed

- **Index Controller**: Added missing `hosturl` variable to `index()` function in `controllers.py`
  - Added `hosturl = LOCAL_URL` following pattern from other working controllers
  - Maintains consistency with payment system and other modules

- **Template Variable Names**: Fixed variable names in `templates/index.html` global variables
  - **Before**: `window.HOSTURL = "[[= HOSTURL ]]";` (undefined variable)
  - **After**: `window.HOSTURL = "[[= hosturl ]]";` (correct lowercase variable)
  - Consistent with other working templates (payment_view.html, daily_transactions.html)

## [2025-06-08T03:17:58.808555] - Dashboard Charts URL Construction Fix

### Fixed

- **API URL Construction Issue**: Resolved chart data API calls failing due to missing app name in URL
  - **Root Cause**: JavaScript was constructing URLs as `/api/chart_data/...` without including the py4web app name
  - **Solution**: Added global variables `window.HOSTURL` and `window.APP_NAME` to dashboard template
  - **URL Pattern**: Fixed to use proper py4web URL format: `${HOSTURL}/${APP_NAME}/api/chart_data/${chartType}/${period}`
  - **Consistency**: Now follows same pattern as payment system and other modules per CHANGELOG.md reference

### Changed

- **Dashboard Template**: Added global variables setup in `templates/index.html`
  - Added `window.HOSTURL = "[[= HOSTURL ]]";` for base URL
  - Added `window.APP_NAME = "[[= app_name ]]";` for app name from settings.py
  - Consistent with established pattern from payment system and files management

- **JavaScript URL Construction**: Enhanced `loadChartData()` method in `static/js/dashboard-charts.js`
  - **Before**: `fetch('/api/chart_data/${chartType}/${period}')`
  - **After**: `fetch('${baseUrl}/${appName}/api/chart_data/${chartType}/${period}')`
  - Added fallback values for missing global variables
  - Proper error handling for URL construction

### Technical Details

- **Global Variables**: Following established pattern from payment system and other modules
- **URL Safety**: Added fallback values (`location.origin` for HOSTURL, `"oph4py"` for APP_NAME)
- **Consistency**: Chart API calls now use same URL construction pattern as worklist, payment, and files modules
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents 404 errors when app is deployed with different name in settings.py

**Files Modified**:

- `templates/index.html` - Added global variables for API access
- `static/js/dashboard-charts.js` - Fixed URL construction with app name

**Impact**: Dashboard charts now load correctly regardless of app name configuration in settings.py
