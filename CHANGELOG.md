  - **User Impact**: Transaction history now shows accurate running balance after each payment

### Technical Implementation

- **Dynamic Balance Calculation**: Modified `displayTransactionHistory()` function to calculate cumulative balances
- **Chronological Processing**: Sorts transactions by date to build accurate payment timeline
- **Real-time Updates**: Balances now reflect current state including cancelled transactions
- **Enhanced Display**: Added balance information to each transaction row for clarity

### User Experience Improvements

- **Before**: Each transaction showed its stored balance which became incorrect over time
- **After**: Each transaction shows the actual cumulative balance at that point in time
- **Visual Enhancement**: Balance information displayed as small text under payment status
- **Accuracy**: Balance calculations now properly exclude cancelled transactions

### Example Balance Progression

- Total Due: €82.00
- After €60.00 payment: Balance €22.00 ✅ (was showing outdated values)
- After €10.00 payment: Balance €12.00 ✅ (now correctly calculated)
- After €10.00 payment: Balance €2.00 ✅ (real-time cumulative)
- After €2.00 payment: Balance €0.00 ✅ (accurate final balance)

## [2025-06-02T04:10:16.939067] - Fixed Transaction Cancellation UI Display Issue

### Fixed

- **Transaction Cancellation Buttons**: Fixed issue where all transactions showed "Cancelled" in the Actions column
  - **Root Cause**: Mismatch between database values ("T"/"F" strings) and py4web boolean expectations (True/False)
  - **Solution**: Updated all `is_active` comparisons and assignments to use boolean values (True/False) instead of strings
  - **Impact**: Cancel buttons now properly appear for active transactions, "Cancelled" text shows only for actually cancelled transactions
  - **Files Modified**: `api/endpoints/payment.py`, `models.py`, `static/js/payment-manager.js`

### Technical Details

- **Before**: API used string comparisons `is_active == "T"` and assignments `is_active="F"`
- **After**: API uses boolean comparisons `is_active == True` and assignments `is_active=False`
- **Database Compatibility**: py4web automatically handles conversion between database CHAR(1) and Python boolean types
- **Validation**: Updated field validation to accept boolean values `IS_IN_SET([True, False])`

### User Experience Improvements

- **Visual Clarity**: Active transactions now show cancel button (🚫) instead of "Cancelled" text
- **Proper Status**: Only actually cancelled transactions show "Cancelled" with strikethrough styling
- **Action Availability**: Cancel buttons only appear for transactions that can actually be cancelled

## [2025-06-02T03:39:22.240227] - Payment Transaction Cancellation Feature

  - **User Tracking**: Records who cancelled the transaction and when in audit notes

### Enhanced

- **Transaction History Display**:
  - Now shows both active and cancelled transactions
  - Cancelled transactions have strikethrough styling and "CANCELLED" badge
  - Added "Actions" column with cancel button for active transactions
  - Visual distinction between active and cancelled transactions

### Technical Implementation

- **Database**: Uses `is_active='F'` to mark cancelled transactions without deletion
- **API Security**: Validates transaction ownership and prevents double-cancellation
- **Frontend**: Enhanced PaymentManager with cancellation workflow and modal handling
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail with user ID, timestamp, and optional reason

### User Experience

- **Non-Destructive**: Transactions are cancelled, not deleted, maintaining complete audit trail
- **Confirmation Flow**: Clear confirmation dialog with transaction details before cancellation
- **Real-time Updates**: Payment balance and status automatically update after cancellation
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of cancelled vs active transactions in history

### API Details

- **Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/worklist/{worklist_id}/transactions/{transaction_id}/cancel`
- **Request Body**: `{"reason": "Optional cancellation reason"}`
- **Response**: Updated balance, payment status, and transaction details
- **Validation**: Ensures transaction exists, belongs to worklist, and is currently active

## [2025-06-02T03:34:56.792744] - Payment Processing User Tracking Fix

### Fixed

- **Transaction User Tracking**: Fixed payment transaction processing to properly capture the logged-in user
  - **Issue**: Transaction history was showing "Unknown" for "Processed By" field
  - **Root Cause**: `created_by` field was not being set when creating transaction records
  - **Solution**: Added `created_by=auth.current_user.get('id')` to transaction creation in payment processing
  - **Impact**: Transaction history now properly shows which user processed each payment
  - **Location**: `api/endpoints/payment.py` - `process_payment()` function

### Technical Details

- **Before**: `created_by` field was NULL, causing "Unknown" to appear in transaction history
- **After**: `created_by` field properly set to current authenticated user ID
- **Database**: `worklist_transactions.created_by` now properly references `auth_user.id`
- **User Experience**: Payment audit trail now shows actual user names instead of "Unknown"

## [2025-06-02T02:27:14.677917] - Payment System Integration

### Added

## [2025-06-02T01:32:37.439670] - Fixed Data Type Validation Errors in Combo Application

### Fixed

- **Validation Error: "Secondary nomenclature code must be a positive integer"**
  - Fixed data type validation errors when applying billing combos with secondary codes
  - Root cause: Combo data was being sent with incorrect data types (`"248835"` as string instead of `248835` as integer)
  - **Issue**: `secondary_nomen_code`, `feecode`, and `secondary_feecode` fields were being sent as strings or "N/A" instead of proper integers or null values
  - Enhanced data type conversion in `applyBillingCombo()` function to properly handle all field types

### Technical Solution

- **Data Type Conversion**: Added proper type conversion for all numeric fields:
  - `nomen_code`: `parseInt(code.nomen_code)` - ensures integer
  - `secondary_nomen_code`: `parseInt(code.secondary_nomen_code)` - ensures integer
  - `fee`: Converts to `parseFloat()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `feecode`: Converts to `parseInt()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `secondary_fee`: Converts to `parseFloat()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `secondary_feecode`: Converts to `parseInt()` or `null` if "N/A"

- **"N/A" Handling**: Properly converts "N/A" string values to `null`:

  ```javascript
  // Before: "N/A" → caused validation error
  // After: "N/A" → null (valid)
  billingData.feecode = (code.feecode === "N/A") ? null : parseInt(code.feecode) || null;
  ```

### Data Format Examples

- **Before (Failed)**:

  ```json
  {
    "secondary_nomen_code": "248835",    // ❌ String instead of integer
    "secondary_feecode": "N/A"          // ❌ String instead of null
  }
  ```

- **After (Working)**:

  ```json
  {
    "secondary_nomen_code": 248835,     // ✅ Integer
    "secondary_feecode": null           // ✅ Null instead of "N/A"
  }
  ```

### User Impact

- **Before**: Combo application failed with validation errors for codes containing secondary nomenclature or fee codes
- **After**: All combo applications work correctly regardless of data format in the combo definition
- **Reliability**: Proper data type conversion prevents API validation errors
- **Robustness**: Handles various data formats that might exist in combo definitions

### Error Prevention

- **Integer Fields**: All code fields are properly converted to integers
- **Null Values**: "N/A", empty strings, and undefined values are converted to null
- **Float Fields**: Fee values are properly converted to floats with null fallback
- **Validation Compliance**: All data types now match API validation requirements

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Combo application now handles all data types correctly

**User Impact**: Billing combos with secondary codes and fee information now apply successfully without validation errors

## [2025-06-02T01:30:01.813551] - Fixed showNotification Scope Error in Combo Application

### Fixed

- **Critical Issue: "Invalid combo_codes format" Error When Applying Billing Combos**
  - Fixed billing combo application that was failing with "Invalid combo_codes format in billing combo" error
  - Root cause: Single backend API call was trying to parse complex combo JSON data which caused parsing failures
  - **New Approach**: Changed from single complex API call to multiple individual `/api/billing_codes` calls
  - Each code in the combo is now applied as a separate billing code entry, eliminating JSON parsing complexity
  - Enhanced error handling with detailed success/failure reporting for each code in the combo

### Technical Solution

- **Previous Approach (Failed)**:

  ```
  POST /api/billing_combo/{id}/apply
  {
    "id_auth_user": 38729,
    "id_worklist": 324576, 
    "note": ""
  }
  ```
  
- **New Approach (Working)**:

  ```
  Multiple calls to POST /api/billing_codes
  {
    "id_auth_user": 38729,
    "id_worklist": 324576,
    "nomen_code": 105755,
    "secondary_nomen_code": 248835,
    // ... other fields per code
  }
  ```

### Enhanced Features

- **Robust Combo Code Parsing**: Uses the same proven parsing logic as combo preview (handles Python-style JSON)
- **Individual Code Processing**: Each code in combo becomes a separate billing entry with full nomenclature data
- **Progress Feedback**: Shows real-time progress during combo application with notification system
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Reports success/failure count with specific error messages for failed codes
- **Partial Success Handling**: Continues processing even if some codes fail, reports detailed results
- **Secondary Code Support**: Full support for combos containing codes with secondary nomenclature
- **Automatic Date Setting**: Uses worklist appointment date or current date for billing entries

### User Experience Improvements

- **Before**: Combo application failed with cryptic "Invalid combo_codes format" error
- **After**: Combo application works reliably with detailed progress and result feedback
- **Progress Indication**: Users see "Applying combo X with Y codes..." notification during processing
- **Detailed Results**: Clear success/failure reporting: "Successfully applied combo X with Y codes!" or partial success details
- **Error Transparency**: Specific error messages for each failed code instead of generic failure

### Technical Implementation

- **Enhanced `applyBillingCombo()` Function**: Complete rewrite using multiple individual API calls
- **New `handleComboApplicationComplete()` Function**: Centralized completion handling with detailed reporting
- **Combo Data Access**: Uses existing `loadedCombos` array for reliable data retrieval
- **Code Format Support**: Handles both old format (integers) and new format (objects with secondary codes)
- **Error Resilience**: Individual code failures don't prevent processing of remaining codes

### Backward Compatibility

- **Combo Data Structure**: Works with existing combo storage formats without changes
- **API Endpoints**: Uses existing proven `/api/billing_codes` endpoint instead of problematic combo-specific endpoint
- **User Interface**: No changes to user workflow - same buttons and modals work as expected
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error reporting maintains existing error handling patterns

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Billing combo application now works reliably using multiple individual API calls

**User Impact**: Users can now successfully apply billing combos of any complexity without JSON parsing errors

  - `'` → `"` (single to double quotes)
  - `True` → `true`
  - `False` → `false`  
  - `None` → `null`
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added debug logging and fallback mechanisms for complex JSON structures
- **Fee Calculation Fix**: Improved handling of "N/A" values to prevent NaN in fee calculations

### User Impact

- **Before**: Combos with secondary codes (like "f2-BIM") showed "Invalid format" in red text
- **After**: All combos display correctly with proper badge formatting for main and secondary codes
- **Enhanced Display**: Secondary codes show as "+code" badges with fee calculations and summaries
- **Debugging**: Added console logging for troubleshooting complex JSON structures

### Code Structure Support

- **Legacy Format**: Simple integer arrays `[105755, 249233, 248975]` (unchanged)
- **Enhanced Format**: Complex objects with secondary codes:

  ```json
  [{"nomen_code": 384230, "fee": 32.85, "secondary_nomen_code": "248835", "secondary_fee": 27.3}]
  ```

- **Mixed Support**: Tables can display both simple and complex formats simultaneously

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - All billing combo formats now display correctly with proper secondary code visualization

- **Payment System API Response Format Fix**: Fixed JavaScript API response parsing
  - **Issue**: PaymentManager was checking for `result.success` but API returns `result.status`
  - **Root Cause**: Mismatch between API response format (`status: "success"`) and JavaScript expectations
  - **Solution**: Updated all API response checks in `static/js/payment-manager.js` to use `result.status === "success"`
  - **Impact**: Fee codes and billing codes now load correctly in payment interface
  - **Files Modified**: `static/js/payment-manager.js`
