## 2025-03-22: Bootstrap-Table Event Handler Integration Fix

### Overview

Fixed critical issues with bootstrap-table integration that were causing "Unknown event in the scope: operateEvents" errors and "Export 'cellStyle_timeslot' is not defined" errors. These issues were preventing proper table initialization and event handling.

### Major Changes

#### 1. Fixed Event Handler Exposure

- Properly defined `operateEvents_wl` as a constant object instead of a function that returns an object
- Ensured consistent export pattern by directly exposing the event handlers object to the global scope
- Added additional debug logging to help diagnose function exposure issues
- Fixed initialization sequence to verify all required functions are properly exposed

#### 2. Added Missing Functions

- Added the missing `cellStyle_timeslot` function for table cell styling
- Implemented `setWlItemStatus` function for AJAX requests to update worklist item status
- Added `fillSelect` function to populate dropdown selects with options from dictionaries
- Implemented `capitalize` helper function for consistent string formatting

#### 3. Improved Global Variable Handling

- Properly initialized `timeOffset` variable in the global scope
- Added null checking for all global variable references with fallbacks
- Fixed references to `$table_wl` by using the global `window.$table_wl` reference
- Added consistent error handling in asynchronous operations

#### 4. Enhanced Initialization Sequence

- Updated initialization sequence to ensure proper ordering of operations
- Added checks for required global variables before module initialization
- Implemented detailed function type checking with clear error messages
- Fixed missing global references to API URLs and application constants

### Files Modified

- `static/js/wl_bt.js`: Fixed function definitions, exports, and global scope exposure
- `templates/worklist.html`: Updated initialization sequence and added checks for required functions

### Technical Details

The key issue was that `operateEvents_wl` was being defined as a function that returns an object, but bootstrap-table expects an object directly. The solution was to define it as a constant object and expose it directly to the global scope:

```javascript
// Before (problematic)
function operateEvents_wl() {
  return {
    "click .edit": function(e, value, row, index) {
      // Event handler code
    }
  };
}
window.operateEvents_wl = operateEvents_wl(); // Calling function

// After (fixed)
const operateEvents_wl = {
  "click .edit": function(e, value, row, index) {
    // Event handler code
  }
};
window.operateEvents_wl = operateEvents_wl; // Direct assignment
```

This fix ensures proper integration with bootstrap-table's event system while maintaining the modular structure of the codebase.

## 2025-03-21 09:34: ES Module Export Fix

### Overview

Fixed ES Module export issues in the JavaScript files to properly expose initialization functions and ensure correct bootstrap-table integration.

### Changes

- Fixed module export pattern in `files_bt.js`
- Consolidated multiple export statements into a single export block
- Ensured proper function exposure through the `init()` function
- Cleaned up redundant code and improved code organization

### Files Modified

- `static/js/files_bt.js`: Fixed export statements and initialization function

### Technical Details

The export pattern was updated to use a single, clear export statement at the end of the module:

```javascript
export {
    init,
    queryParams_wl,
    responseHandler_wl,
    operateFormatter_wl,
    operateEvents_wl,
    rowStyle_wl,
    detailFormatter_wl,
    counterFormatter_wl,
    cellStyle_timeslot,
    rowAttributes_wl,
};
```

This replaced multiple scattered export statements and ensures all necessary functions are properly exposed for use by the bootstrap-table integration.

## 2025-03-21: JavaScript Modernization and Service-Based Architecture

### Overview

Refactored the JavaScript codebase from callback-based jQuery code to a modern ES Module architecture with proper service separation. Fixed critical scoping issues that occurred during the transition and resolved bootstrap-table integration challenges.

### Major Changes

#### 1. Architectural Transition

- Converted from global function-based architecture to proper ES Module pattern
- Implemented service-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Moved from callback patterns to async/await for improved readability
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase

#### 2. New Service Modules

- Created `ApiService.js` for centralized API communication
- Created `WorklistService.js` for worklist-specific operations
- Created `ModalityService.js` for modality-specific operations
- Created `UiService.js` for UI-related operations

#### 3. ES Module Scoping Fixes

- Fixed critical variable scope issues in `queryParams` and `queryParams_wl` functions
- Added proper variable declarations using `let` and `const` throughout the codebase
- Replaced implicit global variables with explicit declarations
- Implemented proper error handling with try/catch blocks

#### 4. Bootstrap-Table Integration

- Fixed "Unknown event in the scope" error by properly exposing callback functions to the global scope
- Resolved double initialization issues by removing automatic initialization from modules
- Created a unified initialization approach in the HTML templates
- Implemented controlled exposure of module functions to the global scope via init() functions

#### 5. Template Updates

- Updated HTML templates to use ES Module imports
- Fixed template URL paths to ensure proper resource loading
- Added proper error logging and debugging support
- Corrected HTML structure with missing table row tags

### Files Modified

- `static/js/files_bt.js`: Updated to ES Module pattern, fixed scoping issues, implemented service usage
- `static/js/wl_bt.js`: Updated to ES Module pattern, fixed scoping issues, implemented service usage
- `static/js/users_bt.js`: Updated to ES Module pattern, fixed scoping issues, implemented service usage
- `static/js/wl.js`: Updated to use services instead of direct function calls
- `templates/manage/files.html`: Updated to properly initialize bootstrap-table with ES Modules
- Created `test/files_bt.html` to test bootstrap-table with ES Modules

### Technical Details

#### ES Module Scoping Issues

Traditional JavaScript allowed undeclared variables to become global automatically:

```javascript
// Old code (problematic in ES modules)
function queryParams_wl(params) {
  search = params.search.split(",");  // Implicit global!
  // ...
}
```

Fixed with proper declarations and null safety:

```javascript
// New code (module-safe)
function queryParams_wl(params) {
  let search = params.search ? params.search.split(",") : [""];
  // ...
}
```

#### Bootstrap-Table Integration Challenges

Bootstrap-table expects formatters and event handlers to be in the global scope, but ES modules keep them isolated. Solved by:

1. Creating explicit initialization functions to expose needed functions to the global scope:

```javascript
function init() {
  // Expose functions to global scope for bootstrap-table
  window.operateFormatter_wl = operateFormatter_wl;
  window.operateEvents_wl = operateEvents_wl;
  // ...
}
```

2. Removing automatic initialization to prevent double initialization:

```javascript
// Remove automatic initialization - let the HTML template do it
// document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", init);
```

3. Explicitly importing and initializing in HTML templates:

```javascript
// Import the module
import { init } from "[[=URL('static', 'js/files_bt.js')]]";

// Initialize the module
init();
```

### Benefits

- **Improved Maintainability**: Clear service-based architecture with separation of concerns
- **Better Testability**: Isolated modules can be tested independently
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch for improved resilience
- **Modern JavaScript**: Leveraging ES Modules for better code organization
- **Consistent Coding Style**: Uniform pattern across all JavaScript files
- **Type Safety**: JSDoc comments for better IDE support and documentation
