## [2025-06-02T01:32:37.439670] - Fixed Data Type Validation Errors in Combo Application

### Fixed

- **Validation Error: "Secondary nomenclature code must be a positive integer"**
  - Fixed data type validation errors when applying billing combos with secondary codes
  - Root cause: Combo data was being sent with incorrect data types (`"248835"` as string instead of `248835` as integer)
  - **Issue**: `secondary_nomen_code`, `feecode`, and `secondary_feecode` fields were being sent as strings or "N/A" instead of proper integers or null values
  - Enhanced data type conversion in `applyBillingCombo()` function to properly handle all field types

### Technical Solution

- **Data Type Conversion**: Added proper type conversion for all numeric fields:
  - `nomen_code`: `parseInt(code.nomen_code)` - ensures integer
  - `secondary_nomen_code`: `parseInt(code.secondary_nomen_code)` - ensures integer
  - `fee`: Converts to `parseFloat()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `feecode`: Converts to `parseInt()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `secondary_fee`: Converts to `parseFloat()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `secondary_feecode`: Converts to `parseInt()` or `null` if "N/A"

- **"N/A" Handling**: Properly converts "N/A" string values to `null`:
  ```javascript
  // Before: "N/A" → caused validation error
  // After: "N/A" → null (valid)
  billingData.feecode = (code.feecode === "N/A") ? null : parseInt(code.feecode) || null;
  ```

### Data Format Examples

- **Before (Failed)**:
  ```json
  {
    "secondary_nomen_code": "248835",    // ❌ String instead of integer
    "secondary_feecode": "N/A"          // ❌ String instead of null
  }
  ```

- **After (Working)**:
  ```json
  {
    "secondary_nomen_code": 248835,     // ✅ Integer
    "secondary_feecode": null           // ✅ Null instead of "N/A"
  }
  ```

### User Impact

- **Before**: Combo application failed with validation errors for codes containing secondary nomenclature or fee codes
- **After**: All combo applications work correctly regardless of data format in the combo definition
- **Reliability**: Proper data type conversion prevents API validation errors
- **Robustness**: Handles various data formats that might exist in combo definitions

### Error Prevention

- **Integer Fields**: All code fields are properly converted to integers
- **Null Values**: "N/A", empty strings, and undefined values are converted to null
- **Float Fields**: Fee values are properly converted to floats with null fallback
- **Validation Compliance**: All data types now match API validation requirements

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Combo application now handles all data types correctly

**User Impact**: Billing combos with secondary codes and fee information now apply successfully without validation errors

## [2025-06-02T01:30:01.813551] - Fixed showNotification Scope Error in Combo Application

### Fixed

- **Critical Issue: "Invalid combo_codes format" Error When Applying Billing Combos**
  - Fixed billing combo application that was failing with "Invalid combo_codes format in billing combo" error
  - Root cause: Single backend API call was trying to parse complex combo JSON data which caused parsing failures
  - **New Approach**: Changed from single complex API call to multiple individual `/api/billing_codes` calls
  - Each code in the combo is now applied as a separate billing code entry, eliminating JSON parsing complexity
  - Enhanced error handling with detailed success/failure reporting for each code in the combo

### Technical Solution

- **Previous Approach (Failed)**: 
  ```
  POST /api/billing_combo/{id}/apply
  {
    "id_auth_user": 38729,
    "id_worklist": 324576, 
    "note": ""
  }
  ```
  
- **New Approach (Working)**: 
  ```
  Multiple calls to POST /api/billing_codes
  {
    "id_auth_user": 38729,
    "id_worklist": 324576,
    "nomen_code": 105755,
    "secondary_nomen_code": 248835,
    // ... other fields per code
  }
  ```

### Enhanced Features

- **Robust Combo Code Parsing**: Uses the same proven parsing logic as combo preview (handles Python-style JSON)
- **Individual Code Processing**: Each code in combo becomes a separate billing entry with full nomenclature data
- **Progress Feedback**: Shows real-time progress during combo application with notification system
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Reports success/failure count with specific error messages for failed codes
- **Partial Success Handling**: Continues processing even if some codes fail, reports detailed results
- **Secondary Code Support**: Full support for combos containing codes with secondary nomenclature
- **Automatic Date Setting**: Uses worklist appointment date or current date for billing entries

### User Experience Improvements

- **Before**: Combo application failed with cryptic "Invalid combo_codes format" error
- **After**: Combo application works reliably with detailed progress and result feedback
- **Progress Indication**: Users see "Applying combo X with Y codes..." notification during processing
- **Detailed Results**: Clear success/failure reporting: "Successfully applied combo X with Y codes!" or partial success details
- **Error Transparency**: Specific error messages for each failed code instead of generic failure

### Technical Implementation

- **Enhanced `applyBillingCombo()` Function**: Complete rewrite using multiple individual API calls
- **New `handleComboApplicationComplete()` Function**: Centralized completion handling with detailed reporting
- **Combo Data Access**: Uses existing `loadedCombos` array for reliable data retrieval
- **Code Format Support**: Handles both old format (integers) and new format (objects with secondary codes)
- **Error Resilience**: Individual code failures don't prevent processing of remaining codes

### Backward Compatibility

- **Combo Data Structure**: Works with existing combo storage formats without changes
- **API Endpoints**: Uses existing proven `/api/billing_codes` endpoint instead of problematic combo-specific endpoint
- **User Interface**: No changes to user workflow - same buttons and modals work as expected
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error reporting maintains existing error handling patterns

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Billing combo application now works reliably using multiple individual API calls

**User Impact**: Users can now successfully apply billing combos of any complexity without JSON parsing errors
