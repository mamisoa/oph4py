## [2025-06-22T23:30:52.410661]

### Fixed

- A critical bug causing a 500 server error ("list index out of range") when filtering the worklist by date. The issue was resolved by changing the API query parameters from `gte`/`lte` to the `pydal`-compatible `ge`/`le` in `templates/worklist.html`.

### Added

- The worklist date filter now defaults to today's date on page load.
- Auto-refresh functionality to the worklist date filter; the table now updates automatically when the start or end dates are changed.
- Date validation to the worklist filter to ensure the start date cannot be set after the end date.

### Changed

- The provider and practitioner selectors on the worklist page now automatically adjust their width to fit their content, improving the layout.

### Removed

- The manual "Filter" button from the worklist page, as filtering is now automatic and triggered by date changes.

## [2025-06-22T22:21:06.430780]

### Changed

- Replaced 'Full list' and 'Today's list' buttons in worklist.html with a date range filter (start/end date inputs, defaulting to today).
- Updated JS logic to build API query with requested_time.gte/lte and provider/practitioner filters.
- Table now refreshes based on date range and filters; default load is today-to-today.
- No backend/API change required; uses py4web RestAPI filtering best practices.

## [2025-06-15T16:22:43.925645]

### Removed - 2025-06-15T16:22:43.925645 - PAYMENT VIEW CONSOLE LOGS CLEANUP

## [2025-06-09T01:25:53.851559] - Image Fallback Infinite Loop Fix

### Fixed

- **Patient Photo Fallback Loop**: Resolved an issue where a missing patient photo and a missing fallback avatar would cause an infinite loop of 404 errors.
  - **Root Cause**: The `onerror` event handler for the patient's photo was re-setting the `src` to the same failing fallback URL, re-triggering the error.
  - **Fix 1 (Path Correction)**: Corrected the path for the default SVG avatars to include `/static/`, resolving the immediate 404 error (e.g., `/oph4py/static/images/assets/avatar/mini-woman.svg`).
  - **Fix 2 (Loop Prevention)**: Made the `onerror` handler more robust by having it remove itself (`onerror = null`) after the first attempt to load the fallback image. This prevents any possibility of an infinite loop if the fallback avatar is also unavailable for any reason.

## [2025-06-08T23:54:47.963687] - MD Summary History Field Data Source Migration

### Changed

- **MD Summary History Data Source**: Migrated history field from `phistory` table to `current_hx` table for improved data consistency

  - **API Enhancement**: Added LEFT JOIN to `current_hx` table in both main and modal MD summary endpoints
  - **Field Aliasing**: Added `current_hx_desc` alias for proper pyDAL field access patterns
  - **Fallback Handling**: Display "-" when `current_hx.description` is empty or null

### Fixed

- **MD Summary 500 Error**: Resolved server error caused by code referencing removed `phistory` fields
  - **Root Cause**: Code still attempted to access `history_title` and `history_note` fields after `phistory` table references were removed
  - **Solution**: Removed all fallback logic references to `phistory` fields and simplified history display logic
  - **Error Prevention**: Streamlined history field processing to use only `current_hx_desc` or "-" placeholder
  - **API Stability**: Both `/api/worklist/{id}/md_summary` and `/api/worklist/{id}/md_summary_modal` endpoints now function reliably

### Removed

- **phistory Table References**: Completely removed all references to `phistory` table from MD summary endpoints
  - **Database Joins**: Removed LEFT JOIN to `phistory` table from both API endpoints
  - **Field Selection**: Removed `history_title` and `history_note` field aliases
  - **Processing Logic**: Eliminated complex fallback logic that combined `phistory.title` and `phistory.note`
  - **Code Simplification**: Streamlined field processing to focus solely on `current_hx` data source

### Technical Details

- **API Changes** (`api/endpoints/payment.py`):
  - Added `db.current_hx.description.with_alias("current_hx_desc")` to field selection
  - Added `LEFT JOIN` to `current_hx` table in both endpoints
  - Simplified history field logic: `row.current_hx_desc or "-"`
  - Removed all `phistory` table joins and field references

- **Data Consistency**: History field now shows unified data from single source (`current_hx` table)
- **Error Recovery**: Proper null handling ensures no display errors for missing history data
- **Performance**: Simplified queries with fewer table joins improve response times

### Benefits

- **Data Consistency**: History information now comes from single authoritative source
- **Improved Reliability**: Elimination of complex fallback logic reduces potential error points
- **Better Performance**: Simpler database queries with fewer table joins
- **User Experience**: History field displays consistently across all consultation records

## [2025-06-08T23:32:54.362491] - Bootbox Confirmation Dialog Overlapped by Navbar

### Fixed

- **Issue**: Bootbox confirmation dialogs (e.g., delete confirmation in worklist view) were partially hidden behind the fixed top navbar, making the dialog header and buttons inaccessible.
