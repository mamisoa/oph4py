### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Payment Transaction Processing Database Commit Issues**: Fixed payment processing endpoints not using py4web's automatic transaction management
- **Controllers Transaction Management**: Removed manual `db.commit()` calls from `facilities()` and `testtable()` functions in `controllers.py` that already use `@action.uses(db)` decorator
- **Auth API Transaction Management**: Fixed `api/endpoints/auth.py` by adding `@action.uses(db)` decorator to `api()` and `octopus()` functions and removing manual `db.commit()` call
  - **Root Cause**: Payment API endpoints were missing `@action.uses(db)` decorator while manually calling `db.commit()` and `db.rollback()`, which is incorrect in py4web
  - **py4web Transaction Management**: With `@action.uses(db)` decorator, py4web automatically handles transaction lifecycle:
    - `on_request`: starts transaction
    - `on_success`: commits transaction automatically 
    - `on_error`: rolls back transaction automatically
  - **Endpoints Fixed**:
    - `/api/worklist/<worklist_id>/payment_summary` - Added `@action.uses(db)`
    - `/api/worklist/<worklist_id>/billing_breakdown` - Added `@action.uses(db)`
    - `/api/worklist/<worklist_id>/payment` - Added `@action.uses(db)` and removed manual `db.commit()`
    - `/api/worklist/<worklist_id>/transactions` - Added `@action.uses(db)`
    - `/api/worklist/<worklist_id>/transactions/<transaction_id>/cancel` - Added `@action.uses(db)` and removed manual commits/rollbacks
    - `/api/worklist/<worklist_id>/md_summary` - Added `@action.uses(db)`
    - `/api/worklist/<worklist_id>/md_summary_modal` - Added `@action.uses(db)`
    - `/api/patient/<patient_id>/md_summary` - Added `@action.uses(db)`
  - **Impact**: Payment transactions now process reliably with proper database consistency and automatic rollback on errors
  - **Database Integrity**: Eliminates potential transaction state issues and ensures proper cleanup on failures

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `api/endpoints/payment.py` - Added proper py4web decorators and removed manual transaction management
- **Framework Compliance**: Now follows py4web best practices for database transaction handling
- **Automatic Rollback**: Database automatically rolls back on any exception, ensuring data consistency
- **Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary manual transaction management overhead
- **Error Handling**: Simplified error handling since rollback is now automatic

### Design Philosophy

- **Framework Best Practices**: Use py4web's built-in transaction management instead of manual control
- **Database Consistency**: Automatic transaction lifecycle management ensures proper ACID properties
- **Simplified Code**: Remove manual commit/rollback complexity and rely on framework automation

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: WorklistState ReferenceError**: Fixed "ReferenceError: WorklistState is not defined" in worklist.html
  - **Root Cause**: Premature call to `WorklistState.Manager.startAutoRefresh()` before `wl-state-manager.js` script was loaded
  - **Solution**: Removed duplicate auto-refresh initialization from main script block (line 950)
  - **Script Loading Order**: Now properly loads external scripts before attempting to use WorklistState object
  - **Impact**: Eliminates JavaScript console errors and ensures proper worklist functionality
  - **Preserved Functionality**: Correct auto-refresh initialization remains in place within the post-load setTimeout

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `templates/worklist.html` - Removed premature WorklistState call
- **Script Loading Pattern**: External scripts → DOM ready → setTimeout → WorklistState usage
- **Redundancy Removed**: Eliminated duplicate auto-refresh calls (kept the properly timed one)
- **Error Prevention**: Ensures all dependencies are loaded before object method calls
- **Fallback Preserved**: Maintains fallback timer logic for cases where WorklistState fails to load

## [2025-06-23T02:37:47.744546]

### Fixed

- **🔧 Username and Email Sanitization**: Fixed autofill functionality in new user modal to remove accents and illegal characters from username and email fields
  - **Root Cause**: When first name contained accented characters (é, à, ç, etc.) or spaces, the auto-generated username and email contained invalid characters
  - **Solution**: Added `sanitizeForUsername()` function that uses existing `norm()` utility to remove accents and filters out non-alphanumeric characters (except underscores)
  - **Sanitization Process**:
    - Converts text to lowercase
    - Removes accents using Unicode normalization (`norm()` function from `useful.js`)
    - Removes spaces and any characters that are not letters, numbers, or underscores
    - Preserves timestamp suffix for uniqueness
  - **Impact**: Username and email fields now contain only valid characters, preventing validation errors and database issues
  - **User Experience**: Automatic username/email generation works reliably for users with accented names (common in French, Belgian, and other European contexts)

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `static/js/manage/users.js` - Enhanced autofill username functionality
- **Function Added**: `sanitizeForUsername(text)` - Handles accent removal and character filtering
- **Integration**: Works with both manual first name entry and Belgian ID card import (EID button)
- **Dependencies**: Uses existing `norm()` function from `static/js/utils/useful.js` for Unicode normalization
- **Pattern**: Follows existing codebase pattern of using utility functions for text processing
- **Backward Compatibility**: No impact on existing user records; only affects new user creation workflow

### Design Philosophy

- **Input Sanitization**: Proactive cleaning of user input to prevent downstream validation issues
- **Internationalization**: Proper handling of accented characters common in European names
- **Consistent Data**: Ensures username fields contain only database-safe characters

### Changed

- **🔄 Worklist MD Modality Button Logic Update**: Modified summary and payment button display logic for MD modality in worklist
  - **New Logic**: 
    - When MD modality is **NOT done**: Show summary button, hide payment button
    - When MD modality is **done**: Show payment button, hide summary button
  - **Other Modalities**: GP and other main modalities maintain existing behavior (show summary when done)
  - **User Experience**: Clearer workflow separation between examination summary (pre-completion) and payment processing (post-completion) for MD procedures
  - **Impact**: Reduces button clutter and provides more intuitive workflow for medical staff

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `static/js/wl/wl_bt.js` - Updated `operateFormatter_wl()` function
- **Implementation**: Replaced generic main modality check with specific MD modality handling
- **Button Logic**: 
  - MD + not done = summary button only
  - MD + done = payment button only  
  - GP + done = summary button (unchanged)
- **Backward Compatibility**: No impact on existing GP or other modality workflows

## [2025-06-23T02:15:49.526789]

### Fixed

- **🔧 Worklist Actions Simplified**: Fixed race conditions and missing table refreshes across all worklist actions
  - **Root Cause**: Complex async patterns with stale data checks and multiple refresh mechanisms were creating race conditions
  - **Solution**: Reverted to simple synchronous approach using proven patterns from MD views
  - **Actions Simplified**:
    - `"click .done"` - Now uses simple `setWlItemStatus()` call with table refresh
    - `"click .unlock"` - Reverted to synchronous pattern with table refresh
    - `"click .stopwatch"` - Simplified counter updates with table refresh
    - `"click .remove"` - Reverted to simple bootbox confirmation + crudp DELETE with table refresh
  - **Impact**: Eliminates ghosting effect where UI shows "done" status that reverts on refresh
  - **Performance**: Faster response for single operations, eliminates unnecessary complexity
  - **User Experience**: Consistent status updates and table refreshes without confusing visual artifacts

### Technical Details

- **Pattern Change**: Moved from async/await with race condition checks back to proven synchronous pattern
- **Removed Complexity**: Eliminated "fresh data" checks that were causing more problems than they solved  
- **Simple Flow**: Click → Create data object → Call function → Function handles crudp + table refresh
- **Race Condition Fix**: Single atomic operation instead of multiple async operations that could interfere
- **Files Modified**: `static/js/wl/wl_bt.js` - Simplified event handlers for done, unlock, stopwatch, and remove actions
- **Dependencies**: Uses existing `setWlItemStatus()` function from `useful.js` and `bootbox` confirmation dialogs
- **Delete Pattern**: Uses same pattern as MD views: bootbox confirmation → crudp DELETE → table refresh

### Design Philosophy

- **Single Operations**: Use simple synchronous patterns for individual status changes
- **Batch Operations**: Reserve complex async patterns only for multi-item operations where coordination is needed
- **Proven Patterns**: Revert to working implementations rather than over-engineering simple operations

## [2025-06-23T01:39:31.784648]

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Auth Signature Fields Not Populated**: Fixed missing authentication on API endpoints causing "undefined undefined" in Created by/Modified by fields
  - **Root Cause**: Multiple API endpoints lacked `@action.uses(auth.user)` decorator, preventing py4web from populating `auth.signature` fields (`created_by`, `modified_by`, `created_on`, `modified_on`)
  - **Endpoints Fixed**:
    - `/api/worklist/batch` - Worklist creation now requires authentication
    - `/api/billing_codes` - Billing codes CRUD operations now require authentication  
    - `/api/billing_codes/by_worklist/<id>` - Billing codes retrieval now requires authentication
    - `/api/billing_combo/<id>/apply` - Combo application now requires authentication
    - `/api/billing_combo_usage` - Combo usage tracking now requires authentication
  - **Impact**: All new records created through these endpoints will now properly track who created/modified them with authenticated user information

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing records remain unchanged; only new records created after this fix will have proper auth signature data

## [2025-06-22T23:30:52.410661]

### Fixed

- A critical bug causing a 500 server error ("list index out of range") when filtering the worklist by date. The issue was resolved by changing the API query parameters from `gte`/`lte` to the `pydal`-compatible `ge`/`le` in `templates/worklist.html`.

### Added

- The worklist date filter now defaults to today's date on page load.
- Auto-refresh functionality to the worklist date filter; the table now updates automatically when the start or end dates are changed.
- Date validation to the worklist filter to ensure the start date cannot be set after the end date.

### Changed

- The provider and practitioner selectors on the worklist page now automatically adjust their width to fit their content, improving the layout.

### Removed

- The manual "Filter" button from the worklist page, as filtering is now automatic and triggered by date changes.

## [2025-06-09T01:25:53.851559] - Image Fallback Infinite Loop Fix

### Fixed

- **Patient Photo Fallback Loop**: Resolved an issue where a missing patient photo and a missing fallback avatar would cause an infinite loop of 404 errors.
  - **Root Cause**: The `onerror` event handler for the patient's photo was re-setting the `src` to the same failing fallback URL, re-triggering the error.
  - **Fix 1 (Path Correction)**: Corrected the path for the default SVG avatars to include `/static/`, resolving the immediate 404 error (e.g., `/oph4py/static/images/assets/avatar/mini-woman.svg`).
