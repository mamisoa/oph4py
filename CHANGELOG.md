## [2025-06-30T00:51:06+02:00]

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Billing Combo Custom Fee Application**: Fixed critical issue where custom fees defined in billing combos were being overwritten with standard nomenclature fees during application
  - **Root Cause**: The `apply_billing_combo` function was always fetching and using standard fees from the nomenclature service, completely ignoring custom fees saved in combo definitions
  - **Impact**: 
    - Custom fees like €31.11 for code 384230 were being replaced with standard fees during combo application
    - Billing combos with negotiated or special pricing were not working as intended
    - Healthcare providers were unable to use custom fee structures for specific procedures
  - **Technical Fix**: Modified fee assignment logic in `api/endpoints/billing.py` to prioritize custom fees from combo definitions:
    - **Main Codes**: Now checks if `code_def.get("fee")` exists before falling back to nomenclature service fee
    - **Secondary Codes**: Same prioritization logic applied to `code_def.get("secondary_fee")`
    - **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to show when custom vs standard fees are being used
  - **User Experience**: 
    - ✅ Custom fees in billing combos now properly applied (e.g., 384230 will use €31.11 instead of standard fee)
    - ✅ Standard fees still used when no custom fee is defined in combo
    - ✅ Both main and secondary code custom fees are respected
    - ✅ Transparent logging shows which fee source is being used for each code

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `api/endpoints/billing.py` - Enhanced `apply_billing_combo()` function (lines 907-950)
- **Logic Change**: 
  - **Before**: Always use `nomenclature.get_code_details().fee` (overwrites custom fees)
  - **After**: Use `code_def.get("fee")` if available, fallback to nomenclature service
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy combos with integer-only codes still work (use standard fees)
- **Enhanced Combos**: New format combos with custom fees now work correctly
- **Logging Enhancement**: Clear distinction between custom and standard fee usage in logs

### Data Integrity

- **Fee Source Priority**: Custom combo fees → Standard nomenclature fees → 0.00 fallback
- **Combo Definition Preservation**: Custom fees in combo definitions remain unchanged
- **Billing Accuracy**: Healthcare providers can now rely on custom fee structures
- **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging provides clear audit trail of fee source decisions

This fix resolves a fundamental issue where the billing combo system's custom fee functionality was completely bypassed, ensuring that healthcare providers can properly use negotiated or special pricing structures through billing combos.

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Billing Combo Usage Tracking**: Fixed critical issue where billing combo usage was never recorded, preventing proper usage-based ordering
- **Frontend Response Parsing**: Fixed frontend parsing to correctly extract created billing codes from backend response (`created_codes` vs `billing_codes`)
- **Backend Combo Code Parsing**: Enhanced parsing to handle Python-style combo codes with single quotes and `None` values instead of JSON format
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend `applyBillingCombo()` function was making individual POST requests to `/api/billing_codes` instead of using the proper combo application endpoint
  - **Impact**: 
    - Combo usage was never recorded in `billing_combo_usage` table
    - Usage-based ordering couldn't work (all combos had usage_count = 0)
    - Combos were ordered by newest instead of most frequently used
    - Backend combo application endpoint with usage tracking was bypassed completely
  - **Technical Fix**: Completely rewrote `applyBillingCombo()` function to use single API call to `/api/billing_combo/<combo_id>/apply` endpoint
  - **Backend Integration**: Now properly utilizes existing usage tracking system that was already implemented in the backend

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `static/js/md/md_bt.js` - Complete rewrite of `applyBillingCombo()` function (lines 2871-2946)
- **API Endpoint Change**: 
  - **Old Flow**: Multiple calls to `POST /api/billing_codes` (one per code) - no usage tracking
  - **New Flow**: Single call to `POST /api/billing_combo/<combo_id>/apply` - includes usage tracking
- **Response Handling**: Updated to process enhanced response with created billing codes and usage record
- **Function Signature**: Enhanced `handleComboApplicationComplete()` to accept optional `createdCodes` parameter
- **State Management**: Added combo list refresh after successful application to reflect new usage counts

### Backend Integration Benefits

- **Automatic Usage Recording**: Each combo application now creates record in `billing_combo_usage` table
- **Enhanced Fee Calculations**: Backend handles complex fee aggregation for main and secondary codes
- **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in backend with transaction support
- **Secondary Code Support**: Proper handling of enhanced combo definitions with secondary billing codes
- **Atomic Operations**: All billing codes created in single transaction with proper rollback support

### User Experience Impact

- **✅ Usage-Based Ordering**: Combos now properly ordered by frequency of use (most used first)
- **✅ Better Success Messages**: Enhanced notifications include secondary code counts and usage tracking confirmation
- **✅ Real-Time Updates**: Combo list refreshes after application to show updated usage ordering
- **✅ Improved Performance**: Single API call instead of multiple individual code creation requests
- **✅ Consistent Behavior**: Combo application now behaves identically to other bulk operations

### Data Consistency

- **Usage Statistics**: Combo usage data will now accumulate correctly from this point forward
- **Historical Data**: Previous combo applications (individual code entries) remain valid but won't count toward usage statistics
- **Ordering Logic**: Most-used combos will appear at top as usage data accumulates
- **Fallback Behavior**: When usage counts are equal, ordering falls back to newest combo first (by ID)

This fix resolves a fundamental disconnect between the frontend implementation and the backend usage tracking system, enabling the intended most-used-first ordering behavior for billing combos.

- **Format Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing combo code formats (both integer arrays and enhanced objects)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with console warnings for unparseable combo codes
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering using native JavaScript string matching methods

### User Experience Impact

- **✅ Better Code Discovery**: Users can now find combos by typing nomenclature codes (e.g., "105755")
- **✅ Description Search**: French descriptions are searchable for better multilingual support  
- **✅ Secondary Code Finding**: Can locate combos containing specific secondary codes
- **✅ Flexible Searching**: Partial matches work across all searchable fields
- **✅ Intuitive Interface**: Clear placeholder text explains the expanded search capabilities

### Search Examples

Users can now filter combos using:

- **Combo Names**: "consultation", "examination"
- **Main Codes**: "105755", "102030" 
- **Secondary Codes**: Any secondary nomenclature codes
- **Descriptions**: French medical terminology
- **Partial Matches**: Any substring in the above fields

This enhancement significantly improves combo discoverability, especially for users who remember specific codes but not combo names.

- **Scalability**: Usage counting approach scales well with growing combo usage data

## [2025-06-26T22:58:06.620240]

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Worklist Single Item Batch Submission**: Fixed critical bug where non-combo worklist items were not being included in batch submissions to the database
  - **Root Cause**: `handleSingleItemInsertion()` function was bypassing the WorklistState.Manager and creating items with simple uniqueIds instead of registering them in the pending items collection
  - **Impact**: Single modality worklist items appeared in the UI preview but were never actually submitted to the database when the form was submitted
  - **Affected Workflow**: 
    - Adding individual modality items (non-combo procedures) to worklist
    - Items showed in preview table but disappeared on form submission
    - Only combo items (multiple modalities) were properly saved to database
  - **Technical Fix**: Modified `handleSingleItemInsertion()` to use `addItemWithTracking()` function which properly registers items with the state manager
  - **Batch Processing**: Single items now properly included in `submitBatch()` operation alongside combo items

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `static/js/wl/wl.js` - Fixed `handleSingleItemInsertion()` function on lines 314-331
- **State Manager Integration**: Single items now use `addItemWithTracking()` to generate proper uniqueIds and register with WorklistState.Manager
- **Pending Items Collection**: Single items are now added to `this.pendingItems` Map which is processed by `getAllCleanPendingItems()`
- **Batch API Compatibility**: Single items now include proper uniqueId tracking for status updates and transaction management
- **UI Consistency**: Maintains existing UI behavior while ensuring database persistence

### User Experience Impact

- **✅ Data Persistence**: Single modality worklist items now properly save to database
- **✅ Batch Operations**: Single and combo items can be mixed in the same batch submission
- **✅ State Tracking**: Single items now participate in transaction status updates and error recovery
- **✅ No UI Changes**: Existing user interface behavior remains identical

### Architecture Benefits

- **Consistent State Management**: All worklist items (single and combo) now use the same state management system
- **Transaction Integrity**: Single items participate in atomic batch transactions with proper rollback support
- **Error Recovery**: Single items now included in transaction recovery and retry mechanisms
- **Debugging Support**: Single items now visible in `debugWorklistState()` output for troubleshooting

This fix resolves a critical data loss issue where users believed they were adding worklist items but only combo items were actually being saved to the database.

## [2025-06-24T00:38:01+02:00]

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Bootstrap Autocomplete jQuery Compatibility**: Fixed "e.fail is not a function" error in medication autocomplete after database commit refactor
  - **Root Cause**: Bootstrap-autocomplete library was incompatible with py4web's response handling changes made during database commit refactor
  - **Error Pattern**: Library was trying to call `.fail()` method on jQuery AJAX promises, but the method was not available due to response format changes
  - **Solution**: Replaced built-in `ajax` resolver with custom `search` function that handles jQuery AJAX promises properly
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - Changed from `resolverSettings` to custom `resolver: 'custom'` with manual AJAX handling
    - Added explicit `dataType: 'json'` to ensure proper response parsing
    - Implemented proper `.done()` and `.fail()` promise handling
    - Added error logging with `console.warn()` for debugging
  - **Impact**: Medication autocomplete in MD view new medication modal now works without JavaScript errors
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains all existing functionality while fixing jQuery compatibility

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `static/js/md/md.js` - Updated medication autocomplete configuration
- **jQuery Compatibility**: Custom AJAX handler ensures proper promise chain handling
- **Error Handling**: Added graceful fallback to empty array on API failures
- **Response Format**: Properly handles py4web's JSON response structure with `response.items`
- **Debugging**: Added console warnings for API errors to aid troubleshooting

### Root Cause Analysis

This issue was introduced during the database commit refactor when changes to `api/core/base.py` affected how API responses are handled. The bootstrap-autocomplete library expects specific jQuery AJAX promise methods that were not available after the response handling changes. The custom resolver approach bypasses the library's internal AJAX handling and provides explicit jQuery compatibility.

## [2025-06-24T00:30:21+02:00]

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Bootstrap Autocomplete Undefined Response Handling**: Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" errors in medication and other autocomplete fields
  - **Root Cause**: Autocomplete `searchPost` functions were not handling cases where API responses return `undefined` or `null` instead of expected `{items: [], count: 0}` structure
  - **Error Pattern**: JavaScript was trying to access `.length` on undefined `res.items` when API endpoints returned malformed or empty responses
  - **Affected Autocomplete Fields**: Fixed all 8 autocomplete implementations across MD and GP views:
    - **MD View**: Medication, Agent, Disease, Lens (left/right), Cleaning Solution (left/right) autocomplete fields
    - **GP View**: Medication, Agent, Disease autocomplete fields
  - **API Endpoints Involved**: `/api/medic_ref`, `/api/agent`, `/api/disease_ref`, `/api/cl`, `/api/cleaning_solution`
  - **Impact**: All autocomplete fields in medical record forms now handle API response errors gracefully without JavaScript crashes

### Technical Details

- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `static/js/md/md.js` - Enhanced 6 autocomplete implementations with null safety
  - `static/js/md/gp.js` - Enhanced 3 autocomplete implementations with null safety
- **Response Validation**: Added existence checks `!res || res.count == 0` to handle null/undefined API responses
- **Fallback Implementation**: Changed `return res.items` to `return res && res.items ? res.items : []` to provide empty array fallback
- **Consistency**: Applied same defensive programming pattern to all autocomplete `searchPost` functions
- **Bootstrap Autocomplete Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with bootstrap-autocomplete library expectations

### User Experience Impact

- **✅ Form Functionality**: New medication modal and other autocomplete forms now work without JavaScript errors
- **✅ Graceful Degradation**: When API endpoints are unavailable, autocomplete fields show empty results instead of crashing
- **✅ Error Prevention**: Eliminates "Cannot read properties of undefined" console errors that blocked form functionality
- **✅ Medical Workflow**: Doctors can now add medications, agents, diseases, and equipment without JavaScript interruptions

### Root Cause Analysis

This issue was triggered by API response format inconsistencies where some endpoints might return `null`, `undefined`, or error responses instead of the expected `{items: array, count: number}` structure. The autocomplete library expected a valid response structure, but the `searchPost` functions lacked defensive programming to handle edge cases. This demonstrates the importance of null-safety checks in JavaScript when consuming API data.

## [2025-06-24T00:23:07+02:00]

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Worklist API Database Transaction Management**: Fixed improper manual database transaction management in worklist API endpoints to follow py4web best practices
  - **Root Cause**: Manual `db.commit()`, `db.rollback()`, and `db._adapter.connection.begin()` calls were redundant and potentially harmful when used with `@action.uses(db)` decorator
  - **py4web Transaction Management**: With `@action.uses(db)` decorator, py4web automatically handles transaction lifecycle:
    - `on_request`: starts transaction
    - `on_success`: commits transaction automatically 
    - `on_error`: rolls back transaction automatically
  - **Endpoints Fixed**:
    - `/api/worklist/batch` - Removed manual transaction management, now uses automatic py4web transactions
    - `/api/worklist/transaction/<transaction_id>` - Added missing `@action.uses(db)` decorator
    - `/api/worklist/transaction/<transaction_id>/retry` - Added missing `@action.uses(db)` decorator and removed manual transaction management
  - **Manual Operations Removed**:
    - 3 instances of `db.commit()` calls eliminated
    - 2 instances of `db.rollback()` calls eliminated  
    - 2 instances of `db._adapter.connection.begin()` calls eliminated
  - **Impact**: Worklist batch operations now use proper py4web transaction management ensuring consistency and automatic rollback on errors

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `api/endpoints/worklist.py` - Comprehensive transaction management cleanup
- **Framework Compliance**: All endpoints now follow py4web best practices for database transaction handling
- **Automatic Rollback**: Database automatically rolls back on any exception, ensuring data consistency
- **Decorator Addition**: Missing `@action.uses(db)` decorators added to transaction status and retry endpoints
- **Code Simplification**: Removed complex manual transaction blocks in favor of framework automation
- **Error Handling**: Simplified error handling since rollback is now automatic on exceptions

### Database Operations Enhanced

- **Batch Creation**: `/api/worklist/batch` endpoint now relies on automatic transaction management for atomic operations
- **Transaction Recovery**: `/api/worklist/transaction/<id>/retry` endpoint now uses proper py4web transaction lifecycle
- **Status Queries**: `/api/worklist/transaction/<id>` endpoint now has proper database access decorators
- **Audit Trail**: Transaction audit entries still created properly but with automatic commit/rollback handling

### Design Philosophy

- **Framework Best Practices**: Use py4web's built-in transaction management instead of manual control
- **Database Consistency**: Automatic transaction lifecycle management ensures proper ACID properties
- **Code Maintainability**: Reduced complexity by removing manual transaction management code
- **Error Safety**: Automatic rollback prevents data corruption on failures

## [2025-01-22T10:30:00.000000]

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Certificates JS Module API Response Handling**: Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" errors in certificates.js module after database refactor
  - **Root Cause**: After API response format changes, certificates.js was still using jQuery response array format `response[0]["items"]` instead of direct JSON object access `response["items"]`
  - **Error Pattern**: JavaScript was trying to access `.length` on undefined objects when API responses were in the new direct JSON format
  - **Affected Functions**: Fixed all 4 data fetching patterns:
    - `getRightAutoRx()` / `getLeftAutoRx()` - AutoRx data for certificate generation
    - `getRightCycloRx()` / `getLeftCycloRx()` - Cycloplegic refraction data  
    - `getRightTrialRx()` / `getLeftTrialRx()` - Trial lens refraction data
    - `getRightTono()` / `getLeftTono()` - Tonometry/pachymetry data
  - **API Parameter Fix**: Fixed tono API endpoints to use proper pyDAL syntax `id_auth_user.eq=` instead of `id_auth_user=`
  - **Impact**: Certificate generation in MD view now works correctly with proper data population from examination results

### Technical Details

- **File Fixed**: `static/js/md/certificates.js` - Updated all API response handling patterns
- **Response Format Change**: Changed from `response[0]["items"]` to `response["items"]` to match new JSON serialization
- **Null Safety**: Added existence checks with `response["items"] && response["items"].length > 0` pattern
- **API Parameters**: Fixed `templates/modalityCtr/js-sections/md-apis.html` tono endpoints to use correct query syntax
- **Data Flow**: Certificate generation objects (`autorxObjFill`, `cyclorxObjFill`, `trialrxObjFill`, `tonoObjFill`) now populate correctly

### User Experience Impact

- **✅ Certificate Generation**: Doctors can now generate certificates with proper examination data inclusion
- **✅ Data Integration**: AutoRx, cyclo, trial lens, and tonometry measurements properly appear in certificates
- **✅ Error Elimination**: Removed JavaScript console errors that were preventing certificate functionality
- **✅ Medical Workflow**: Complete certificate workflow restoration for MD examinations

### Root Cause Analysis

This issue was a follow-on effect from the API JSON serialization fixes. While the main API endpoints were corrected to return proper JSON, the certificates.js module was still using the older jQuery response array format. This demonstrates the importance of comprehensive testing across all JavaScript modules that consume API data after framework-level changes.

## [2025-01-21T22:05:00.000000]

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Modality Options API Broken After Database Refactor**: Fixed worklist modality dropdown not loading options due to JSON serialization issues introduced during database commit cleanup
  - **Root Cause**: Database commit refactor accidentally broke JSON serialization in `handle_rest_api_request()` function by using `str()` on RestAPI response objects instead of proper JSON serialization
  - **API Response Issue**: Server was returning Python dict representation with single quotes and datetime objects instead of valid JSON:
    ```python
    # Before Fix (Invalid JSON)
    {'items': [{'created_on': datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 19, 2, 1, 29), ...}]}
    
    # After Fix (Valid JSON)  
    {"items": [{"created_on": "2021-04-19 02:01:29", ...}]}
    ```
  - **Frontend Error**: JavaScript was receiving malformed JSON causing "Expected property name or '}' in JSON" parsing errors
  - **Secondary Issue**: Lookup field access pattern required bracket notation for flattened field names with dots

### Technical Details

- **File Fixed**: `api/core/base.py` - `handle_rest_api_request()` function
- **JSON Serialization**: Replaced `str(json_resp)` with proper `json.dumps()` with datetime handling
- **Datetime Handling**: Added custom serializer for `datetime.datetime` and `datetime.date` objects
- **Frontend Fix**: Updated field access pattern in `static/js/wl/wl.js` for py4web lookup fields
- **Field Access Pattern**: Used bracket notation `item['id_modality.id']` for flattened lookup field names

### API Endpoint Corrections

- **Modality API Endpoint**: Changed from non-existent `/api/modality` to proper `/api/procedure_family` with lookup
- **Database Relationships**: Correctly uses `procedure_family` junction table to get modalities for procedures  
- **Lookup Syntax**: Added `@lookup=id_modality!:id_modality[id,modality_name]` for proper field joins
- **Field Access**: Fixed JavaScript to handle py4web's flattened field naming convention

### User Experience Impact

- **✅ Modality Dropdown**: Now properly loads available modalities when procedure is selected
- **✅ Form Validation**: Prevents API calls with undefined procedure IDs
- **✅ Error Handling**: Enhanced debugging and user feedback for API failures
- **✅ Worklist Creation**: Users can now create worklist items with proper modality selection

### Root Cause Analysis

This issue demonstrates the importance of comprehensive testing after framework-level changes. The database commit refactor, while correct for transaction management, inadvertently affected a core utility function used by multiple API endpoints. The fix ensures proper JSON serialization while maintaining the improved transaction management.

## [2025-01-21T15:30:00.000000]

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Database Commit Implementation Fixes**: Comprehensive cleanup of manual database transaction management across multiple modules to follow py4web best practices
  - **Root Cause**: Manual `db.commit()` calls were redundant and potentially harmful when used with `@action.uses(db)` decorator which provides automatic transaction management
  - **py4web Transaction Management**: With `@action.uses(db)` decorator, py4web automatically handles transaction lifecycle:
    - `on_request`: starts transaction
    - `on_success`: commits transaction automatically 
    - `on_error`: rolls back transaction automatically
  - **Files Fixed**:
    - **`manage.py`**: Removed manual `db.commit()` from `change_password()` function and added missing `@action.uses(db)` decorators to 6 database management functions
    - **`api/core/base.py`**: Removed manual `db.commit()` from `handle_rest_api_request()` utility function and improved type safety
    - **`api/endpoints/billing.py`**: Removed 4 manual `db.commit()` calls and eliminated manual transaction management in `apply_billing_combo()` function

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Payment Transaction Processing Database Commit Issues**: Fixed payment processing endpoints not using py4web's automatic transaction management
- **Controllers Transaction Management**: Removed manual `db.commit()` calls from `facilities()` and `testtable()` functions in `controllers.py` that already use `@action.uses(db)` decorator
- **Auth API Transaction Management**: Fixed `api/endpoints/auth.py` by adding `@action.uses(db)` decorator to `api()` and `octopus()` functions and removing manual `db.commit()` call
  - **Root Cause**: Payment API endpoints were missing `@action.uses(db)` decorator while manually calling `db.commit()` and `db.rollback()`, which is incorrect in py4web
  - **py4web Transaction Management**: With `@action.uses(db)` decorator, py4web automatically handles transaction lifecycle:
    - `on_request`: starts transaction
    - `on_success`: commits transaction automatically 
    - `on_error`: rolls back transaction automatically
  - **Endpoints Fixed**:
    - `/api/worklist/<worklist_id>/payment_summary` - Added `@action.uses(db)`
    - `/api/worklist/<worklist_id>/billing_breakdown` - Added `@action.uses(db)`
    - `/api/worklist/<worklist_id>/payment` - Added `@action.uses(db)` and removed manual `db.commit()`

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: WorklistState ReferenceError**: Fixed "ReferenceError: WorklistState is not defined" in worklist.html
  - **Root Cause**: Premature call to `WorklistState.Manager.startAutoRefresh()` before `wl-state-manager.js` script was loaded
  - **Solution**: Removed duplicate auto-refresh initialization from main script block (line 950)
  - **Script Loading Order**: Now properly loads external scripts before attempting to use WorklistState object
  - **Impact**: Eliminates JavaScript console errors and ensures proper worklist functionality
  - **Preserved Functionality**: Correct auto-refresh initialization remains in place within the post-load setTimeout

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `templates/worklist.html` - Removed premature WorklistState call
- **Script Loading Pattern**: External scripts → DOM ready → setTimeout → WorklistState usage
- **Redundancy Removed**: Eliminated duplicate auto-refresh calls (kept the properly timed one)
- **Error Prevention**: Ensures all dependencies are loaded before object method calls
- **Fallback Preserved**: Maintains fallback timer logic for cases where WorklistState fails to load

### Fixed

- **🔧 Username and Email Sanitization**: Fixed autofill functionality in new user modal to remove accents and illegal characters from username and email fields
  - **Root Cause**: When first name contained accented characters (é, à, ç, etc.) or spaces, the auto-generated username and email contained invalid characters
  - **Solution**: Added `sanitizeForUsername()` function that uses existing `norm()` utility to remove accents and filters out non-alphanumeric characters (except underscores)
  - **Sanitization Process**:
    - Converts text to lowercase
    - Removes accents using Unicode normalization (`norm()` function from `useful.js`)
    - Removes spaces and any characters that are not letters, numbers, or underscores
    - Preserves timestamp suffix for uniqueness
  - **Impact**: Username and email fields now contain only valid characters, preventing validation errors and database issues
  - **User Experience**: Automatic username/email generation works reliably for users with accented names (common in French, Belgian, and other European contexts)

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `static/js/manage/users.js` - Enhanced autofill username functionality
- **Function Added**: `sanitizeForUsername(text)` - Handles accent removal and character filtering
- **Integration**: Works with both manual first name entry and Belgian ID card import (EID button)
- **Dependencies**: Uses existing `norm()` function from `static/js/utils/useful.js` for Unicode normalization
- **Pattern**: Follows existing codebase pattern of using utility functions for text processing
- **Backward Compatibility**: No impact on existing user records; only affects new user creation workflow

### Design Philosophy

- **Input Sanitization**: Proactive cleaning of user input to prevent downstream validation issues
- **Internationalization**: Proper handling of accented characters common in European names
- **Consistent Data**: Ensures username fields contain only database-safe characters

### Changed

- **🔄 Worklist MD Modality Button Logic Update**: Modified summary and payment button display logic for MD modality in worklist
  - **New Logic**: 
    - When MD modality is **NOT done**: Show summary button, hide payment button
    - When MD modality is **done**: Show payment button, hide summary button
  - **Other Modalities**: GP and other main modalities maintain existing behavior (show summary when done)
  - **User Experience**: Clearer workflow separation between examination summary (pre-completion) and payment processing (post-completion) for MD procedures
  - **Impact**: Reduces button clutter and provides more intuitive workflow for medical staff

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `static/js/wl/wl_bt.js` - Updated `operateFormatter_wl()` function
- **Implementation**: Replaced generic main modality check with specific MD modality handling
- **Button Logic**: 
  - MD + not done = summary button only
  - MD + done = payment button only  
  - GP + done = summary button (unchanged)
- **Backward Compatibility**: No impact on existing GP or other modality workflows

## [2025-06-23T02:15:49.526789]

### Fixed

- **🔧 Worklist Actions Simplified**: Fixed race conditions and missing table refreshes across all worklist actions
  - **Root Cause**: Complex async patterns with stale data checks and multiple refresh mechanisms were creating race conditions
  - **Solution**: Reverted to simple synchronous approach using proven patterns from MD views
  - **Actions Simplified**:
    - `"click .done"` - Now uses simple `setWlItemStatus()` call with table refresh
    - `"click .unlock"` - Reverted to synchronous pattern with table refresh
    - `"click .stopwatch"` - Simplified counter updates with table refresh
    - `"click .remove"` - Reverted to simple bootbox confirmation + crudp DELETE with table refresh
  - **Impact**: Eliminates ghosting effect where UI shows "done" status that reverts on refresh
  - **Performance**: Faster response for single operations, eliminates unnecessary complexity
  - **User Experience**: Consistent status updates and table refreshes without confusing visual artifacts

### Technical Details

- **Pattern Change**: Moved from async/await with race condition checks back to proven synchronous pattern
- **Removed Complexity**: Eliminated "fresh data" checks that were causing more problems than they solved  
- **Simple Flow**: Click → Create data object → Call function → Function handles crudp + table refresh
- **Race Condition Fix**: Single atomic operation instead of multiple async operations that could interfere
- **Files Modified**: `static/js/wl/wl_bt.js` - Simplified event handlers for done, unlock, stopwatch, and remove actions
- **Dependencies**: Uses existing `setWlItemStatus()` function from `useful.js` and `bootbox` confirmation dialogs
- **Delete Pattern**: Uses same pattern as MD views: bootbox confirmation → crudp DELETE → table refresh

### Design Philosophy

- **Single Operations**: Use simple synchronous patterns for individual status changes
- **Batch Operations**: Reserve complex async patterns only for multi-item operations where coordination is needed
- **Proven Patterns**: Revert to working implementations rather than over-engineering simple operations

## [2025-06-23T01:39:31.784648]

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL: Auth Signature Fields Not Populated**: Fixed missing authentication on API endpoints causing "undefined undefined" in Created by/Modified by fields
  - **Root Cause**: Multiple API endpoints lacked `@action.uses(auth.user)` decorator, preventing py4web from populating `auth.signature` fields (`created_by`, `modified_by`, `created_on`, `modified_on`)
  - **Endpoints Fixed**:
    - `/api/worklist/batch` - Worklist creation now requires authentication
    - `/api/billing_codes` - Billing codes CRUD operations now require authentication  
    - `/api/billing_codes/by_worklist/<id>` - Billing codes retrieval now requires authentication
    - `/api/billing_combo/<id>/apply` - Combo application now requires authentication
    - `/api/billing_combo_usage` - Combo usage tracking now requires authentication
  - **Impact**: All new records created through these endpoints will now properly track who created/modified them with authenticated user information
  - **User Experience**: "Created by" and "Modified by" fields in MD view billing codes and other interfaces will now show actual user names instead of "undefined undefined"

### Security

- **Enhanced API Security**: All billing and worklist creation endpoints now require user authentication, improving audit trails and access control
- **Data Integrity**: Auth signature fields now properly populated for all new records, ensuring complete audit history

### Technical Details

- **py4web Auth Integration**: Proper use of `@action.uses(auth.user, db)` decorator ensures authenticated user context is available during record creation
- **Automatic Field Population**: py4web's `auth.signature` mechanism now works correctly to populate `created_by`, `modified_by`, `created_on`, and `modified_on` fields
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing records remain unchanged; only new records created after this fix will have proper auth signature data

## [2025-06-22T23:30:52.410661]

### Fixed

- A critical bug causing a 500 server error ("list index out of range") when filtering the worklist by date. The issue was resolved by changing the API query parameters from `gte`/`lte` to the `pydal`-compatible `ge`/`le` in `templates/worklist.html`.

### Added

- The worklist date filter now defaults to today's date on page load.
- Auto-refresh functionality to the worklist date filter; the table now updates automatically when the start or end dates are changed.
- Date validation to the worklist filter to ensure the start date cannot be set after the end date.

### Changed

- The provider and practitioner selectors on the worklist page now automatically adjust their width to fit their content, improving the layout.

### Removed

- The manual "Filter" button from the worklist page, as filtering is now automatic and triggered by date changes.

## [2025-06-22T22:21:06.430780]

### Changed

- Replaced 'Full list' and 'Today's list' buttons in worklist.html with a date range filter (start/end date inputs, defaulting to today).
- Updated JS logic to build API query with requested_time.gte/lte and provider/practitioner filters.
- Table now refreshes based on date range and filters; default load is today-to-today.
- No backend/API change required; uses py4web RestAPI filtering best practices.
