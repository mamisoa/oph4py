## [2025-07-14T23:21:09.306792]

### Added

- **üîó Direct Relationship Between Billing Codes and Combo Applications**: Implemented reliable tracking of which billing codes were created by combo applications
  - **Database Schema**: Added `id_billing_combo_usage` foreign key field to `billing_codes` table for direct traceability
  - **Improved Combo Application**: Modified combo application logic to create usage record first, then link all generated billing codes to it
  - **Reliable Combo Removal**: Replaced unreliable timing-based code matching with direct foreign key relationship lookup
    - **Before**: Used 10-minute time windows and fallback strategies to guess which codes belonged to a combo
    - **After**: Direct SQL query `WHERE id_billing_combo_usage = ?` for precise code identification
  - **Benefits**:
    - **100% Accurate Removal**: No more orphaned billing codes when removing combo applications
    - **Better Data Integrity**: Clear audit trail of which codes came from which combo applications
    - **Performance**: Faster queries using foreign key index instead of time range scans
    - **Foundation**: Enables future combo analytics and reporting features

### Fixed

- **üêõ Combo Removal Reliability**: Fixed issue where combo removal would fail to delete associated billing codes
  - **Root Cause**: Time-based matching was unreliable due to transaction timing variations
  - **Solution**: Direct foreign key relationship ensures 100% accurate code-to-combo association

## [2025-07-14T22:36:33.268927]

### Fixed

- **üîß Consultation History Markdown Rendering**: Fixed issue where consultation history was displaying raw HTML instead of rendered markdown
  - **Root Cause**: API returns conclusions with existing HTML `<span class="badge">` elements for laterality indicators, but markdown renderer was escaping all HTML first
  - **Solution**: Enhanced markdown renderer to handle mixed HTML/markdown content intelligently
    - **Preservation**: Laterality badges (right/left/both) are preserved as-is from the API
    - **Selective Processing**: Markdown formatting is applied only to text content, not existing HTML elements
    - **Line-by-Line Processing**: Each conclusion line is processed separately to handle multiple conclusions properly
  - **Files Modified**:

## [2025-07-14T08:45:30.000000]

### Fixed

- **üîß Critical JavaScript Global Variable Dependencies**: Fixed "ReferenceError: patientObj is not defined" and related variable errors in autorx and tono views
  - **Root Cause**: Recent modularization of `md-globals.html` removed global variables that autorx.html and tono.html controllers depend on
  - **Issue**: The variable consolidation in [2025-07-13T03:09:02.003404] moved variables to `md-globals.html` but autorx/tono templates couldn't access them
  - **Solution**: Created shared global variables architecture:
    - **New File**: `templates/modalityCtr/js-sections/shared-globals.html` (103 lines) - Contains core variables needed by all modality controllers
    - **Template Conditional Logic**: Added proper py4web template conditionals for missing context variables
    - **Fallback Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for templates without worklist/patient context
  - **Updated Templates**:
    - **autorx.html**: Now includes shared-globals.html, provides APP_NAME, patientObj, genderIdObj, and other missing variables
    - **tono.html**: Now includes shared-globals.html, ensures patient-bar.js has required variables
  - **Variable Coverage**:
    - Core IDs: `wlId`, `patientId`, `APP_NAME`, `HOSTURL`
    - Patient data: `patientObj`, `wlObj`, `genderIdObj`, `providerObj`, `seniorObj`
    - Medical data: `userObj`, `usermdObj`, `prescRxObj`, `phoneDict`, `mdHistory`
    - Window object exposure: All critical variables available via `window.variableName` for fallback access
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing functionality while providing shared variable access
  - **Modular Architecture**: Preserves the benefits of modularization while fixing cross-template dependencies

### Enhanced

- **üåê Template Variable Safety**: All modality controllers now have safe access to essential global variables
- **üõ°Ô∏è Graceful Degradation**: Templates without full context (patient/worklist data) now handle missing variables gracefully
- **üîÑ Consistent Variable Access**: Standardized variable access pattern across md.html, autorx.html, and tono.html templates

## [2025-07-13T04:40:17.641862]

### Fixed

- **üîÑ Transaction History True Chronological Order**: Fixed ordering to show actual sequence of when transactions were created
  - **Issue**: Using `modified_on` for ordering caused active transactions to appear out of chronological order
  - **Root Cause**: Active transactions have `modified_on` = `created_on`, but cancelled transactions have `modified_on` = cancellation time
  - **Database Analysis**: Revealed active transactions were created earlier (02:32:xx) but showing later due to `modified_on` ordering
  - **Solution**: Changed ordering to use `created_on` field for true chronological sequence
  - **API Changes**: 
    - Updated ordering from `~db.worklist_transactions.modified_on` to `~db.worklist_transactions.created_on`
    - Added `created_on` field to API response
  - **Frontend Changes**: 
    - Updated JavaScript sorting to use `created_on` for chronological order
    - Date display now shows when transaction was created (not when cancelled)
  - **Result**: Transaction history now shows proper sequence:
    1. Most recent payments first (when they were created)
    2. Earlier payments next
    3. Cancellations show in their proper chronological position
  - **User Experience**: True audit trail showing when events actually occurred in the payment workflow

### Enhanced

- **üïê Transaction History Date & Time Display**: Enhanced date column to show both date and time for better chronological visibility
  - **Column Header**: Changed from "Date" to "Date & Time" to reflect new functionality
  - **Time Display**: Now shows full date and time (e.g., "13/07/2025, 10:30:45 AM") instead of just date
  - **Smart Date Logic**: 
    - **Active Transactions**: Shows `transaction_date` (when payment was made)
    - **Cancelled Transactions**: Shows `modified_on` (when transaction was cancelled)
  - **Formatting**: Uses `toLocaleString()` for user-friendly date/time display
  - **Chronological Clarity**: Users can now see the exact time sequence of all payment events
  - **Audit Trail**: Provides precise timestamps for compliance and debugging purposes
  - **User Experience**: Eliminates confusion when multiple transactions occur on the same day

## [2025-07-13T04:35:18.681466]

### Fixed

- **üìÖ Transaction History Chronological Order**: Fixed transaction ordering to show actual sequence of events
  - **Issue**: Transactions were ordered by `transaction_date` (original payment date), causing cancelled transactions to appear out of chronological order
  - **Root Cause**: When transactions are cancelled, the `transaction_date` doesn't change, but `modified_on` reflects the cancellation time
  - **Solution**: Changed ordering to use `modified_on` field instead of `transaction_date`
  - **API Changes**: 
    - Updated `transaction_history` endpoint to order by `~db.worklist_transactions.modified_on`
    - Added `modified_on` field to API response for frontend sorting
  - **Frontend Changes**: Updated JavaScript sorting to use `modified_on` with fallback to `transaction_date`
  - **Impact**: Transaction history now shows proper chronological sequence:
    - Recent cancellations appear first (based on when they were cancelled)
    - Recent payments appear next (based on when they were created/modified)
    - Provides accurate audit trail of actual event sequence
  - **User Experience**: Users can now see the true timeline of payment events, not just original payment dates

  - **Template Updates**: Updated HTML table structure to accommodate new column
  - **Column Count**: All colspan attributes updated from 8 to 9 columns

## [2025-07-13T04:26:02.396806]

### Fixed

- **üîß Payment Transaction User Tracking**: Fixed "Processed by" field showing "None None" in transaction history
  - **Root Cause**: Payment API endpoints were missing `auth.user` decorator, causing `auth.current_user` to be unavailable

## [2025-07-13T03:22:40.608199]

### Fixed

- **üîß API Validation Error Detection**: Fixed conclusions API error handling where validation errors were showing success toasts instead of error messages
  - **Root Cause**: JavaScript was checking `response.errors` which was truthy for empty objects `{}`, causing false positive error detection
  - **Solution**: Updated error detection to check if errors object has actual content: `(response.errors && Object.keys(response.errors).length > 0)`
  - **Enhanced Success Detection**: Changed from `response.success !== false` to explicit `response.status === "success"` check
  - **User Feedback**: API validation errors now properly display error toasts with specific validation messages

- **üîß Laterality Value Validation**: Fixed "Value not allowed" validation error when adding conclusions
  - **Root Cause**: Database constraint expects `("right", "left", "na")` but HTML forms were sending "general" value
  - **Database Constraint**: `db.ccx.laterality.requires = IS_IN_SET(("right", "left", "na"))`
  - **Solution**: Changed "general" laterality value to "na" in both add and edit conclusion forms
  - **JavaScript Mapping**: Updated laterality mapping to use "na" for "Both" option in bootstrap-table interface

  - **Root Cause**: `APP_NAME` and `HOSTURL` were declared in both `baseof.html` and `md-globals.html`, causing "Identifier already declared" errors
  - **Solution**: Removed duplicate declarations from `md-globals.html` since variables are already available from `baseof.html`
  - **Enhanced Error Handling**: Updated `conclusions-bt.js` to use fallback pattern for global variables with proper error checking
  - **Improved Robustness**: Added checks for both direct variable access and window object fallbacks
  - **Timing Issues**: Fixed immediate variable access in multiple JavaScript files that tried to use variables before they were loaded
  - **Affected Files**: Fixed undefined variable errors in multiple scripts including:
    - `patient-bar.js`: Wrapped patient object initialization in deferred function

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2025-07-13T03:04:28.193587]

### Fixed

- **üîß Critical Variable Declaration Conflicts**: Fixed "Identifier 'APP_NAME' has already been declared" and multiple undefined variable errors
  - **Root Cause**: Duplicate variable declarations between `patient-bar.html` and `md-globals.html`, plus incorrect loading order
  - **Solution**: Moved all variable declarations to `md-globals.html` and removed duplicates from `patient-bar.html`
  - **Loading Order Fix**: Ensured global variables are defined before scripts that depend on them
- **üîß Bootstrap-Table Auto-Initialization**: Fixed double initialization by detecting existing table instances
  - **Root Cause**: Template has `data-toggle="table"` which auto-initializes, then JavaScript tried to initialize again
  - **Solution**: Added detection for existing bootstrap-table instances using `$("#conclusionsTable").data('bootstrap.table')`
  - **Fallback**: Gracefully handles both auto-initialized and manually initialized tables
- **üåê Global Variable Availability**: Made `HOSTURL` and `APP_NAME` available on window object for all scripts
  - **Issue**: Scripts loaded after globals couldn't access these critical configuration variables
  - **Solution**: Added `window.HOSTURL` and `window.APP_NAME` assignments for global access

### Enhanced

- **üìã Consolidated Variable Management**: All template variables now centralized in `md-globals.html`
- **üõ°Ô∏è Robust Table Initialization**: Bootstrap-table initialization now handles all scenarios safely

## [2025-07-13T03:01:15.584825]

### Fixed

- **üîß Bootstrap-Table Double Initialization**: Fixed "You cannot initialize the table more than once!" error in conclusions-bt.js
  - **Root Cause**: Bootstrap-table was being initialized multiple times without protection
