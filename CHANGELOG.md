  - **File Size Reduction**: Main template reduced from 3,086 to 2,823 lines (8.5% reduction)

### Technical Achievements

- **Strict Dependency Order Preserved**: Critical 4-level JavaScript dependency chain maintained:
  1. Global variables (template data ‚Üí JavaScript variables)
  2. External libraries (bootstrap-table, useful.js, md_bt.js, etc.)
  3. API endpoints (depends on HOSTURL, APP_NAME, patientId, wlId)
  4. Bootstrap tables (depends on API endpoints)
  5. Initialization (depends on all tables and DOM elements)
  6. Medical logic scripts (md.js, prescription.js, etc.)

- **Bootstrap Table Infrastructure Preserved**: All 19 table variables remain globally accessible
  - Medical history tables: mx_tbl, ax_tbl, mHx_tbl, sHx_tbl, oHx_tbl
  - Examination tables: rxRight/Left_tbl, tonoRight/Left_tbl, kmRight/Left_tbl

  ```html
  [[ block page_head]]
  [[ include 'modalityCtr/styles/md-responsive.html' ]]
  [[ include 'modalityCtr/styles/md-billing.html' ]]
  [[ end ]]
  
  [[ block js_scripts]]
  [[ include 'modalityCtr/js-sections/md-globals.html' ]]
  [external libraries]
  [[ include 'modalityCtr/js-sections/md-apis.html' ]]
  [[ include 'modalityCtr/js-sections/md-tables.html' ]]
  [[ include 'modalityCtr/js-sections/md-init.html' ]]
  [medical logic scripts]
  [[ end ]]
  ```

### Validation Results

- **All dependency requirements met**: Global variables, API endpoints, table variables properly accessible
- **Navigation refresh logic intact**: Back navigation and referrer-based table refresh preserved
- **File size targets achieved**: Each component <300 lines (largest is md-apis.html at 76 lines)

## [2025-06-02T04:18:13.522889] - Fixed Payment Balance Display Issue

### Fixed

- **Transaction History Balance Display**: Fixed incorrect balance display in transaction history
  - **Root Cause**: Each transaction stored its own balance at creation time, but these became obsolete when new transactions were added
  - **Problem**: Historical transactions showed outdated balances that didn't reflect the true cumulative payment state
  - **Solution**: Enhanced JavaScript to calculate real-time cumulative balances instead of using stored values
  - **User Impact**: Transaction history now shows accurate running balance after each payment

### Technical Implementation

- **Dynamic Balance Calculation**: Modified `displayTransactionHistory()` function to calculate cumulative balances
- **Chronological Processing**: Sorts transactions by date to build accurate payment timeline
- **Real-time Updates**: Balances now reflect current state including cancelled transactions
- **Enhanced Display**: Added balance information to each transaction row for clarity

### User Experience Improvements

- **Before**: Each transaction showed its stored balance which became incorrect over time
- **After**: Each transaction shows the actual cumulative balance at that point in time
- **Visual Enhancement**: Balance information displayed as small text under payment status
- **Accuracy**: Balance calculations now properly exclude cancelled transactions

### Example Balance Progression

- Total Due: ‚Ç¨82.00
- After ‚Ç¨60.00 payment: Balance ‚Ç¨22.00 ‚úÖ (was showing outdated values)
- After ‚Ç¨10.00 payment: Balance ‚Ç¨12.00 ‚úÖ (now correctly calculated)
- After ‚Ç¨10.00 payment: Balance ‚Ç¨2.00 ‚úÖ (real-time cumulative)
- After ‚Ç¨2.00 payment: Balance ‚Ç¨0.00 ‚úÖ (accurate final balance)

## [2025-06-02T04:10:16.939067] - Fixed Transaction Cancellation UI Display Issue

### Fixed

- **Transaction Cancellation Buttons**: Fixed issue where all transactions showed "Cancelled" in the Actions column
  - **Root Cause**: Mismatch between database values ("T"/"F" strings) and py4web boolean expectations (True/False)
  - **Solution**: Updated all `is_active` comparisons and assignments to use boolean values (True/False) instead of strings
  - **Impact**: Cancel buttons now properly appear for active transactions, "Cancelled" text shows only for actually cancelled transactions
  - **Files Modified**: `api/endpoints/payment.py`, `models.py`, `static/js/payment-manager.js`

### Technical Details

- **Before**: API used string comparisons `is_active == "T"` and assignments `is_active="F"`
- **After**: API uses boolean comparisons `is_active == True` and assignments `is_active=False`
- **Database Compatibility**: py4web automatically handles conversion between database CHAR(1) and Python boolean types
- **Validation**: Updated field validation to accept boolean values `IS_IN_SET([True, False])`

### User Experience Improvements

- **Visual Clarity**: Active transactions now show cancel button (üö´) instead of "Cancelled" text
- **Proper Status**: Only actually cancelled transactions show "Cancelled" with strikethrough styling
- **Action Availability**: Cancel buttons only appear for transactions that can actually be cancelled

## [2025-06-02T03:39:22.240227] - Payment Transaction Cancellation Feature

### Added

- **Transaction Cancellation Functionality**: Added ability to cancel payment transactions without deleting them

  - **User Tracking**: Records who cancelled the transaction and when in audit notes

### Enhanced

- **Transaction History Display**:
  - Now shows both active and cancelled transactions
  - Cancelled transactions have strikethrough styling and "CANCELLED" badge
  - Added "Actions" column with cancel button for active transactions
  - Visual distinction between active and cancelled transactions

### Technical Implementation

- **Database**: Uses `is_active='F'` to mark cancelled transactions without deletion
- **API Security**: Validates transaction ownership and prevents double-cancellation
- **Frontend**: Enhanced PaymentManager with cancellation workflow and modal handling
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail with user ID, timestamp, and optional reason

### User Experience

- **Non-Destructive**: Transactions are cancelled, not deleted, maintaining complete audit trail
- **Confirmation Flow**: Clear confirmation dialog with transaction details before cancellation
- **Real-time Updates**: Payment balance and status automatically update after cancellation
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of cancelled vs active transactions in history

### API Details

- **Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/worklist/{worklist_id}/transactions/{transaction_id}/cancel`
- **Request Body**: `{"reason": "Optional cancellation reason"}`
- **Response**: Updated balance, payment status, and transaction details
- **Validation**: Ensures transaction exists, belongs to worklist, and is currently active

## [2025-06-02T03:34:56.792744] - Payment Processing User Tracking Fix

### Fixed

- **Transaction User Tracking**: Fixed payment transaction processing to properly capture the logged-in user
  - **Issue**: Transaction history was showing "Unknown" for "Processed By" field
  - **Root Cause**: `created_by` field was not being set when creating transaction records
  - **Solution**: Added `created_by=auth.current_user.get('id')` to transaction creation in payment processing
  - **Impact**: Transaction history now properly shows which user processed each payment
  - **Location**: `api/endpoints/payment.py` - `process_payment()` function

### Technical Details

- **Before**: `created_by` field was NULL, causing "Unknown" to appear in transaction history
- **After**: `created_by` field properly set to current authenticated user ID
- **Database**: `worklist_transactions.created_by` now properly references `auth_user.id`
- **User Experience**: Payment audit trail now shows actual user names instead of "Unknown"

## [2025-06-02T02:27:14.677917] - Payment System Integration

### Added

- **Payment Action Button**: Added '$' (dollar sign) button to worklist interface for completed procedures
  - Button appears only when `status_flag` is 'done'
  - Located in the action column alongside existing buttons (edit, delete, summary, etc.)
  - Provides direct access to payment processing interface
- **Worklist Integration**: Payment button implemented across all modality interfaces:
