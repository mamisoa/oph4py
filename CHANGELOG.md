## [2025-07-13T03:04:28.193587]

### Fixed

- **üîß Critical Variable Declaration Conflicts**: Fixed "Identifier 'APP_NAME' has already been declared" and multiple undefined variable errors
  - **Root Cause**: Duplicate variable declarations between `patient-bar.html` and `md-globals.html`, plus incorrect loading order
  - **Solution**: Moved all variable declarations to `md-globals.html` and removed duplicates from `patient-bar.html`
  - **Loading Order Fix**: Ensured global variables are defined before scripts that depend on them
- **üîß Bootstrap-Table Auto-Initialization**: Fixed double initialization by detecting existing table instances
  - **Root Cause**: Template has `data-toggle="table"` which auto-initializes, then JavaScript tried to initialize again
  - **Solution**: Added detection for existing bootstrap-table instances using `$("#conclusionsTable").data('bootstrap.table')`
  - **Fallback**: Gracefully handles both auto-initialized and manually initialized tables
- **üåê Global Variable Availability**: Made `HOSTURL` and `APP_NAME` available on window object for all scripts
  - **Issue**: Scripts loaded after globals couldn't access these critical configuration variables
  - **Solution**: Added `window.HOSTURL` and `window.APP_NAME` assignments for global access

### Enhanced

- **üìã Consolidated Variable Management**: All template variables now centralized in `md-globals.html`
- **üõ°Ô∏è Robust Table Initialization**: Bootstrap-table initialization now handles all scenarios safely

## [2025-07-13T03:01:15.584825]

### Fixed

- **üîß Bootstrap-Table Double Initialization**: Fixed "You cannot initialize the table more than once!" error in conclusions-bt.js
  - **Root Cause**: Bootstrap-table was being initialized multiple times without protection
  - **Solution**: Added `conclusionsInitialized` flag to prevent double initialization
  - **Protection**: Added table existence check before initialization
- **üîß Global Variable Access**: Fixed undefined global variables issue by switching from `window` object to direct variable access
  - **Root Cause**: Variables were defined as numbers but not properly assigned to window object
  - **Solution**: Changed from `window.wlId` to direct `wlId` access pattern
  - **Validation**: Enhanced variable validation with proper `typeof` checks
- **üöÄ Proper Initialization Order**: Added conclusions initialization to md-init.html for proper loading sequence
  - **Integration**: Added `initConclusionsBootstrapTable()` call to document ready handler
  - **Safety**: Added function existence check before calling initialization

### Enhanced

- **üêõ Better Debugging**: Improved console logging to show actual variable values and types
- **üõ°Ô∏è Robust Validation**: Enhanced variable validation to handle various undefined states

## [2025-07-13T02:57:46.224234]

### Fixed

- **üîß Critical Template Syntax Fix**: Fixed "Worklist ID not available" error in conclusions-bt.js by correcting template variable syntax
  - **Root Cause**: Template variables `wlId` and `patientId` were using quoted syntax `"[[= wlId ]]"` instead of unquoted `[[= wlId ]]`
  - **Solution**: Updated both `templates/modalityCtr/js-sections/md-globals.html` and `templates/modalityCtr/gp.html` to use correct template syntax matching `patient-bar.html` pattern
  - **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive console logging in `conclusions-bt.js` to help diagnose variable availability issues
  - **Validation Improvements**: Enhanced validation to check for undefined strings and empty values
  - **Files Modified**: 
    - `templates/modalityCtr/js-sections/md-globals.html` - Fixed template syntax
    - `templates/modalityCtr/gp.html` - Fixed template syntax  
    - `static/js/md/conclusions-bt.js` - Enhanced debugging and validation

## [2025-07-13T01:23:05.861088]

### Fixed

- **üö® CRITICAL: Certificate Modal Data Population**: Fixed certificate modal not automatically filling refraction and tonometry data
  - **Root Cause**: Certificate modal was calling certificate generation functions immediately when opened, but examination data was fetched asynchronously on page load and might not be available yet
  - **Error Pattern**: Certificate templates showed empty values for refraction and tonometry measurements because data objects were not populated
  - **Affected Functions**: All certificate types that include examination data:
    - `docCert()` - Medical report with trial refraction and tonometry data
    - `preopCert()` - Pre-operative report with cycloplegic refraction and trial visual acuity
    - `postopCert()` - Post-operative report with examination results
    - `orthoCert()` - Orthoptic prescription certificate
  - **Solution**: Modified certificate modal to fetch fresh examination data when opened using Promise.all() for parallel API calls
  - **Impact**: Certificate generation now reliably includes current examination data with proper refraction and tonometry values

### Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `static/js/md/certificates.js` - Complete refactor of certificate modal event handler
- **Data Fetching**: Changed from page-load async calls to on-demand fresh data fetching when modal opens
- **API Calls**: Implemented parallel fetching of 8 examination data endpoints:
  - AutoRx (right/left) - Automated refraction measurements
  - CycloRx (right/left) - Cycloplegic refraction measurements  
  - TrialRx (right/left) - Trial lens refraction with visual acuity
  - Tonometry (right/left) - Intraocular pressure and pachymetry
- **User Experience**: Added loading indicator while fetching data and error handling for failed requests
- **Data Objects**: Fresh population of `autorxObjFill`, `cyclorxObjFill`, `trialrxObjFill`, `tonoObjFill` objects

### User Experience Impact

- **‚úÖ Reliable Data**: Certificate generation now always includes the most recent examination data
- **‚úÖ Medical Accuracy**: Refraction and tonometry values are correctly populated in all certificate types
- **‚úÖ Real-time Updates**: Fresh data is fetched each time a certificate is generated
- **‚úÖ Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures with user-friendly error messages
- **‚úÖ Loading Feedback**: Users see loading indicator while examination data is being fetched

### Fixed

- **üîß Billing Combo Apply Error**: Fixed "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'N/A'" error when applying billing combos
  - **Root Cause**: Combo data contained `"feecode": "N/A"` which was being passed to integer conversion without validation
  - **Solution**: Added proper validation to skip feecode values that are "N/A", "null", "None", or empty strings
  - **Impact**: Billing combos with "N/A" feecode values can now be applied successfully
  - **Files Modified**: `api/endpoints/billing.py` - Enhanced feecode handling in `apply_billing_combo` function
  - **Validation Added**: Both primary and secondary feecode fields now properly validate before assignment
