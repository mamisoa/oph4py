  - **Solution**: Implemented correct py4web transaction pattern based on official documentation:
    1. Let py4web handle automatic transaction management via `@action.uses(db)`
    2. Keep explicit `db.commit()` calls after database operations for immediate persistence
    3. Enhanced `db.rollback()` in exception handling with proper error logging
    4. **Correction**: Removed incorrect `db._adapter.connection.begin()` calls that are not part of standard py4web patterns
  - **Files Fixed**:
    - `api/endpoints/payment.py` - `process_payment()` function: Added explicit transaction management
    - `api/endpoints/payment.py` - `cancel_transaction()` function: Added explicit transaction management
  - **Pattern Source**: Based on official py4web/pyDAL documentation and corrected understanding of transaction management
  - **Result**: Payment transactions now properly committed and immediately visible in transaction history with connection pooling

- After €10.00 payment: Balance €2.00 ✅ (real-time cumulative)
- After €2.00 payment: Balance €0.00 ✅ (accurate final balance)

## [2025-06-02T04:10:16.939067] - Fixed Transaction Cancellation UI Display Issue

### Fixed

- **Transaction Cancellation Buttons**: Fixed issue where all transactions showed "Cancelled" in the Actions column
  - **Root Cause**: Mismatch between database values ("T"/"F" strings) and py4web boolean expectations (True/False)
  - **Solution**: Updated all `is_active` comparisons and assignments to use boolean values (True/False) instead of strings
  - **Impact**: Cancel buttons now properly appear for active transactions, "Cancelled" text shows only for actually cancelled transactions
  - **Files Modified**: `api/endpoints/payment.py`, `models.py`, `static/js/payment-manager.js`

### Technical Details

- **Before**: API used string comparisons `is_active == "T"` and assignments `is_active="F"`
- **After**: API uses boolean comparisons `is_active == True` and assignments `is_active=False`
- **Database Compatibility**: py4web automatically handles conversion between database CHAR(1) and Python boolean types
- **Validation**: Updated field validation to accept boolean values `IS_IN_SET([True, False])`

### User Experience Improvements

- **Visual Clarity**: Active transactions now show cancel button (🚫) instead of "Cancelled" text
- **Proper Status**: Only actually cancelled transactions show "Cancelled" with strikethrough styling
- **Action Availability**: Cancel buttons only appear for transactions that can actually be cancelled

## [2025-06-02T01:32:37.439670] - Fixed Data Type Validation Errors in Combo Application

### Fixed

- **Validation Error: "Secondary nomenclature code must be a positive integer"**
  - Fixed data type validation errors when applying billing combos with secondary codes
  - Root cause: Combo data was being sent with incorrect data types (`"248835"` as string instead of `248835` as integer)
  - **Issue**: `secondary_nomen_code`, `feecode`, and `secondary_feecode` fields were being sent as strings or "N/A" instead of proper integers or null values
  - Enhanced data type conversion in `applyBillingCombo()` function to properly handle all field types

### Technical Solution

- **Data Type Conversion**: Added proper type conversion for all numeric fields:
  - `nomen_code`: `parseInt(code.nomen_code)` - ensures integer
  - `secondary_nomen_code`: `parseInt(code.secondary_nomen_code)` - ensures integer
  - `fee`: Converts to `parseFloat()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `feecode`: Converts to `parseInt()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `secondary_fee`: Converts to `parseFloat()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `secondary_feecode`: Converts to `parseInt()` or `null` if "N/A"

- **"N/A" Handling**: Properly converts "N/A" string values to `null`:

  ```javascript
  // Before: "N/A" → caused validation error
  // After: "N/A" → null (valid)
  billingData.feecode = (code.feecode === "N/A") ? null : parseInt(code.feecode) || null;
  ```

### Data Format Examples

- **Before (Failed)**:

  ```json
  {
    "secondary_nomen_code": "248835",    // ❌ String instead of integer
    "secondary_feecode": "N/A"          // ❌ String instead of null
  }
  ```

- **After (Working)**:

  ```json
  {
    "secondary_nomen_code": 248835,     // ✅ Integer
    "secondary_feecode": null           // ✅ Null instead of "N/A"
  }
  ```

### User Impact

- **Before**: Combo application failed with validation errors for codes containing secondary nomenclature or fee codes
- **After**: All combo applications work correctly regardless of data format in the combo definition
- **Reliability**: Proper data type conversion prevents API validation errors
- **Robustness**: Handles various data formats that might exist in combo definitions

### Error Prevention

- **Integer Fields**: All code fields are properly converted to integers
- **Null Values**: "N/A", empty strings, and undefined values are converted to null
- **Float Fields**: Fee values are properly converted to floats with null fallback
- **Validation Compliance**: All data types now match API validation requirements

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Combo application now handles all data types correctly

**User Impact**: Billing combos with secondary codes and fee information now apply successfully without validation errors

    "id_worklist": 324576, 
    "note": ""
  }
  ```
  
- **New Approach (Working)**:

  ```
  Multiple calls to POST /api/billing_codes
  {
    "id_auth_user": 38729,
    "id_worklist": 324576,
    "nomen_code": 105755,
    "secondary_nomen_code": 248835,
    // ... other fields per code
  }

## [2025-06-02T00:23:35.206035] - Bug Fixes

## [2025-06-02T00:27:27.183831] - Fixed Duplicate Form Validation Error Dialog

### Fixed

- **False "Main nomenclature code is required" Alert After Successful Submission**
  - Fixed issue where users received validation error alert even after billing codes were successfully saved
  - Removed duplicate form submit handlers that were causing conflicting validation
  - The form had two submit handlers: one for actual submission (working correctly) and one for validation only (causing false alerts)
  - Integrated validation directly into the main submit handler to maintain proper validation without conflicts

### Technical Details

- **Root Cause**: Two separate event handlers attached to the same form submission event
  - Main handler: Processed data successfully and saved to database
  - Validation handler: Ran after main handler on reset/empty form fields, triggering false validation errors
- **Solution**: Removed redundant validation submit handler and integrated validation into main submit handler
- **Validation Logic**: Added proper validation after data processing but before API submission
- **User Experience**: Form submission now provides accurate feedback without false error alerts

### User Impact

- **Before**: Users saw "Main nomenclature code is required" alert even when billing codes saved successfully
- **After**: Clean form submission experience with accurate validation only when actually needed
- **Functionality**: All validation logic preserved, just integrated into single submit handler
- **Performance**: Eliminated redundant event handler execution

### Code Quality

- **Single Responsibility**: One submit handler now handles both validation and submission
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation timing ensures accurate user feedback
- **Maintainability**: Simplified event handling reduces code complexity and potential conflicts
