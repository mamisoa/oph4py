## [2025-06-09T01:25:53.851559] - Image Fallback Infinite Loop Fix

### Fixed

- **Patient Photo Fallback Loop**: Resolved an issue where a missing patient photo and a missing fallback avatar would cause an infinite loop of 404 errors.
  - **Root Cause**: The `onerror` event handler for the patient's photo was re-setting the `src` to the same failing fallback URL, re-triggering the error.
  - **Fix 1 (Path Correction)**: Corrected the path for the default SVG avatars to include `/static/`, resolving the immediate 404 error (e.g., `/oph4py/static/images/assets/avatar/mini-woman.svg`).
  - **Fix 2 (Loop Prevention)**: Made the `onerror` handler more robust by having it remove itself (`onerror = null`) after the first attempt to load the fallback image. This prevents any possibility of an infinite loop if the fallback avatar is also unavailable for any reason.

## [2025-06-08T18:36:43.648841] - Fixed Billing Combo View Selector Bug

### Fixed

- **"All Combos" | "My Combos" Switch Not Working**: Resolved critical bug in billing combo view selector functionality
  - **Root Cause**: API endpoint extracted `view` parameter from query string but never used it to modify query conditions
  - **Impact**: Both "My Combos" and "All Combos" options showed identical results (only user's combos + legacy combos)
  - **Affected API Calls**:
    - `GET /api/billing_combo?view=my` - Should show user's combos + legacy combos
    - `GET /api/billing_combo?view=all` - Should show ALL combos in database
  - **Fix**: Implemented proper view mode logic in query condition building

### Enhanced

- **View Mode Implementation** (`api/endpoints/billing.py`):

  ```python
  # Build query conditions based on view mode
  if view_mode == "all":
      # Show all combos (no ownership filtering)
      query_conditions = db.billing_combo.id > 0  # Base condition to get all records
      logger.info("Using 'all' view mode - showing all combos")
  else:
      # Default to 'my' view mode - show only user's combos + legacy combos
      query_conditions = ownership_filter
      logger.info("Using 'my' view mode - showing user's combos + legacy combos")
  ```

- **Security Preservation**: PUT/DELETE operations still maintain ownership filtering regardless of view mode
  - **Viewing vs Modifying**: Users can view all combos in "All Combos" mode but can only modify their own combos + legacy combos
  - **Access Control Integrity**: Ownership checks remain intact for all modification operations
  - **Proper Authorization**: 403 errors still returned for unauthorized modification attempts

### Technical Details

- **Bug Location**: Lines 419-425 in `api/endpoints/billing.py`
- **Previous Behavior**:

  ```python
  view_mode = query_params.get("view", "my")  # Extracted but ignored
  query_conditions = ownership_filter  # Always used ownership filter
  ```

- **Fixed Behavior**: View mode parameter now properly controls query filtering
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added debug logging to track view mode selection and query building

### Benefits

- **Functional View Selector**: Users can now actually switch between "My Combos" and "All Combos" views
- **Proper Data Visibility**: "All Combos" mode shows truly all combos in the database as intended
- **Maintained Security**: Viewing permissions relaxed while modification permissions remain strict
- **Better User Experience**: Toggle switch now provides meaningful different views as designed

**Files Modified**:

- `api/endpoints/billing.py` - Fixed view mode parameter handling in billing combo endpoint

**Impact**: Billing combo view selector now works correctly, allowing users to distinguish between their personal combos and all available combos in the system.

### Fixed

- **JSON Parsing Error for Legacy Combos**: Resolved critical issue with legacy billing combo data in detail view expansion
  - **Root Cause**: Legacy combos stored with Python syntax (single quotes, `None` values) caused JSON parsing failures in new detail view functions
  - **Affected Functions**: `generateCodeBreakdown()` and `calculateComboTotal()` were using direct `JSON.parse()` without fallback handling
  - **Impact**: Users could not expand detail rows for legacy combos, receiving "Unable to parse combo codes" errors
  - **Solution**: Implemented dual parsing logic matching existing formatter patterns:
    - **Primary Parse**: Attempts standard JSON parsing first
    - **Fallback Parse**: Uses eval with Python-to-JavaScript conversion for legacy format
    - **Safe Conversion**: Handles `'` ‚Üí `"`, `None` ‚Üí `null`, `True` ‚Üí `true`, `False` ‚Üí `false`

- **Backward Compatibility**: All legacy billing combos now display correctly in detail view
  - **Detail Expansion**: Legacy combos can now be expanded to show creation info, code breakdown, and pricing
  - **Code Breakdown**: Individual nomenclature codes display properly with correct fee information
  - **Total Calculation**: Price totals calculate correctly for both legacy and modern combo formats
  - **No Data Migration Required**: Existing data remains unchanged, solution handles format differences transparently

### Enhanced

  - **Graceful Degradation**: Detail view continues to work even when individual code parsing fails
  - **Error Messaging**: Clear error indicators when code data cannot be processed
  - **Format Detection**: Automatic detection and handling of different data storage formats
  - **Consistent Patterns**: Follows same dual parsing approach used in existing table formatters

### Technical Implementation

- **JavaScript Enhancements** (`static/js/billing/billing-combo-manager.js`):

  ```javascript
  // Enhanced generateCodeBreakdown() with dual parsing
  try {
      codes = JSON.parse(value); // Try JSON first
  } catch (e) {
      try {
          // Fallback: handle Python format
          const pythonConverted = value
              .replace(/'/g, '"')
              .replace(/None/g, 'null')
              .replace(/True/g, 'true')
              .replace(/False/g, 'false');
          codes = JSON.parse(pythonConverted);
      } catch (e2) {
          return 'Unable to parse combo codes';
      }
  }
  ```

- **Pattern Consistency**: Matches existing dual parsing logic from `enhancedCodesFormatter` and `priceFormatter`
  - **Same Error Handling**: Consistent error recovery patterns across all combo data processing
  - **Format Support**: Universal support for both JSON and Python-formatted combo storage
  - **No Performance Impact**: Fallback parsing only triggered when JSON parsing fails

  def billing_combo(rec_id: Optional[int] = None):
  ```

- **Ownership Filter Logic**:

  ```python
  # Build ownership filter: user's combos OR legacy combos (created_by IS NULL)
  ownership_filter = (db.billing_combo.created_by == auth.user_id) | (db.billing_combo.created_by == None)
  ```

- **Access Control Implementation**:

  ```python
  # GET: Apply ownership filter to query
  query_conditions = ownership_filter & additional_filters
  
  # PUT/DELETE: Verify ownership before operation
  record = db(ownership_filter & (db.billing_combo.id == rec_id)).select().first()
  if not record:
      return APIResponse.error(message="Access denied", status_code=403)
  ```

- **Response Format Compatibility**:

  ```python
  # Maintains existing frontend compatibility

## [2025-06-02T04:10:16.939067] - Fixed Transaction Cancellation UI Display Issue

### Fixed

- **Transaction Cancellation Buttons**: Fixed issue where all transactions showed "Cancelled" in the Actions column
  - **Root Cause**: Mismatch between database values ("T"/"F" strings) and py4web boolean expectations (True/False)
  - **Solution**: Updated all `is_active` comparisons and assignments to use boolean values (True/False) instead of strings
  - **Impact**: Cancel buttons now properly appear for active transactions, "Cancelled" text shows only for actually cancelled transactions
  - **Files Modified**: `api/endpoints/payment.py`, `models.py`, `static/js/billing/payment-manager.js`

### Technical Details

- **Before**: API used string comparisons `is_active == "T"` and assignments `is_active="F"`
- **After**: API uses boolean comparisons `is_active == True` and assignments `is_active=False`
- **Database Compatibility**: py4web automatically handles conversion between database CHAR(1) and Python boolean types
- **Validation**: Updated field validation to accept boolean values `IS_IN_SET([True, False])`

### User Experience Improvements

- **Visual Clarity**: Active transactions now show cancel button (üö´) instead of "Cancelled" text
- **Proper Status**: Only actually cancelled transactions show "Cancelled" with strikethrough styling

## [2025-06-02T01:32:37.439670] - Fixed Data Type Validation Errors in Combo Application

### Fixed

- **Validation Error: "Secondary nomenclature code must be a positive integer"**
  - Fixed data type validation errors when applying billing combos with secondary codes
  - Root cause: Combo data was being sent with incorrect data types (`"248835"` as string instead of `248835` as integer)
  - **Issue**: `secondary_nomen_code`, `feecode`, and `secondary_feecode` fields were being sent as strings or "N/A" instead of proper integers or null values
  - Enhanced data type conversion in `applyBillingCombo()` function to properly handle all field types

### Technical Solution

- **Data Type Conversion**: Added proper type conversion for all numeric fields:
  - `nomen_code`: `parseInt(code.nomen_code)` - ensures integer
  - `secondary_nomen_code`: `parseInt(code.secondary_nomen_code)` - ensures integer
  - `fee`: Converts to `parseFloat()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `feecode`: Converts to `parseInt()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `secondary_fee`: Converts to `parseFloat()` or `null` if "N/A"
  - `secondary_feecode`: Converts to `parseInt()` or `null` if "N/A"

- **"N/A" Handling**: Properly converts "N/A" string values to `null`:

  ```javascript
  // Before: "N/A" ‚Üí caused validation error
  // After: "N/A" ‚Üí null (valid)
  billingData.feecode = (code.feecode === "N/A") ? null : parseInt(code.feecode) || null;
  ```

### Data Format Examples

- **Before (Failed)**:

  ```json
  {
    "secondary_nomen_code": "248835",    // ‚ùå String instead of integer
    "secondary_feecode": "N/A"          // ‚ùå String instead of null
  }
  ```

- **After (Working)**:

  ```json
  {
    "secondary_nomen_code": 248835,     // ‚úÖ Integer
    "secondary_feecode": null           // ‚úÖ Null instead of "N/A"
  }
  ```

### User Impact

- **Before**: Combo application failed with validation errors for codes containing secondary nomenclature or fee codes
- **After**: All combo applications work correctly regardless of data format in the combo definition
- **Reliability**: Proper data type conversion prevents API validation errors
- **Robustness**: Handles various data formats that might exist in combo definitions

### Error Prevention

- **Integer Fields**: All code fields are properly converted to integers
- **Null Values**: "N/A", empty strings, and undefined values are converted to null
- **Float Fields**: Fee values are properly converted to floats with null fallback
- **Validation Compliance**: All data types now match API validation requirements

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Combo application now handles all data types correctly

**User Impact**: Billing combos with secondary codes and fee information now apply successfully without validation errors

    "id_worklist": 324576, 
    "note": ""
  }
  ```
  
- **New Approach (Working)**:

  ```
  Multiple calls to POST /api/billing_codes
  {
    "id_auth_user": 38729,
    "id_worklist": 324576,
    "nomen_code": 105755,
    "secondary_nomen_code": 248835,
    // ... other fields per code
  }
