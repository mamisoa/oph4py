# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently focused on enhancing user experience and email functionality in the application. Recent work includes:

1. Email Functionality Enhancement
   - Added editable email fields to prescription and certificate modals
   - Improved email customization options
   - Enhanced user feedback for email operations
   - Maintained consistent behavior across all modals

2. User Interface Improvements
   - Pre-populated email fields with patient data
   - Added client-side email validation
   - Improved error handling and user notifications
   - Maintained consistent UI patterns across modals

## Current Focus: Worklist Combo Issue

### Issue Description
When adding a worklist with a combo (multiple worklist items), sometimes one of the items is incorrectly added to an existing worklist from another patient, causing data corruption.

### Root Causes Identified
1. Lack of proper transaction handling for combo additions
2. Race conditions in async operations
3. Insufficient validation of patient-item relationships
4. Global state management issues
5. No proper error handling and rollback mechanisms

### Proposed Solutions

#### 1. Transaction Support
- Implement transaction wrapper for combo additions
- Add rollback mechanism for failed operations
- Ensure atomic operations for multi-item additions

#### 2. Data Validation
- Add comprehensive validation for worklist items
- Validate patient-item relationships
- Implement pre-submission checks

#### 3. State Management
- Create WlItemManager class for better state control
- Track pending and processing items
- Prevent concurrent operations for same patient

#### 4. Error Handling
- Add try-catch blocks in critical sections
- Implement proper error reporting
- Add validation error messages

#### 5. UI Synchronization
- Improve form state management
- Add loading states
- Ensure proper table refresh timing

#### 6. Locking Mechanism
- Implement patient-level locks during combo processing
- Add timeout mechanisms
- Handle lock release properly

## Recent Changes

- Added editable email fields to GxRxModal, CxRxModal, and certificateModal
- Implemented pre-population of email fields with patient data
- Added client-side email validation
- Updated email sending logic to use customizable addresses
- Improved user feedback messages
- Maintained consistent behavior across all modals

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring and improving email functionality:
   - Gather user feedback on the new email customization feature
   - Monitor email delivery success rates
   - Consider adding email templates for different types of communications
   - Implement email tracking if needed

2. User Interface Refinements:
   - Consider adding email history or tracking
   - Evaluate need for additional email customization options
   - Monitor user interaction with email features
   - Consider adding email preview functionality

3. Implement transaction handling
4. Add data validation layer
5. Refactor state management
6. Add error handling
7. Improve UI synchronization
8. Add locking mechanism

## Active Decisions

1. Email Functionality
   - Using editable email fields in all relevant modals
   - Pre-populating with patient email by default
   - Implementing consistent validation across all forms
   - Providing clear user feedback for all operations

2. User Interface Patterns
   - Maintaining consistent modal layouts
   - Using standard Bootstrap form components
   - Implementing clear validation feedback
   - Following established notification patterns

## Current Status

- Email functionality improvements are complete
- User interface is consistent across all modals
- All changes are tracked in CHANGELOG.md
- Following established patterns for form handling and validation
