# Active Context: Billing Combo Access Control Implementation

## Current Task

Implementing access control for billing combos to make them accessible only to their creators, with legacy combos (without creators) remaining accessible to everyone.

## Implementation Plan Status

### ✅ Analysis Complete

- **Model Status:** No changes needed - `billing_combo` table already has `auth.signature` providing `created_by` field
- **Current API:** Export/Import endpoints have authentication, main CRUD endpoint lacks ownership filtering

### ✅ Implementation Complete

#### Step 1: API Endpoint Modifications (COMPLETED)

**File:** `api/endpoints/billing.py` - **DONE**

**Changes Implemented:**

- ✅ Added `@action.uses(auth.user)` to main `billing_combo` endpoint
- ✅ Replaced `handle_rest_api_request` with custom ownership-aware logic
- ✅ Implemented ownership filtering: `(db.billing_combo.created_by == auth.user_id) | (db.billing_combo.created_by == None)`

**Access Control Logic Implemented:**

- **GET Requests:** ✅ Shows only user's combos + legacy combos (created_by = NULL)
- **PUT/DELETE:** ✅ Ownership check before allowing operation (403 error if access denied)
- **POST:** ✅ Creates new combos with automatic creator assignment via auth.signature

**Key Features Implemented:**

- **Backward Compatibility:** Legacy combos without creators remain accessible to all users
- **Enhanced Security:** Users can only see/modify their own combos + shared legacy combos
- **Proper Error Handling:** 403 access denied for unauthorized access, 404 for not found
- **Search & Filtering:** Maintains all existing query capabilities with ownership constraints
- **Response Format Compatibility:** Returns data in same format expected by frontend

#### Next Steps (Optional)

2. Test the API changes with existing frontend
3. Monitor for any edge cases or frontend adjustments needed
4. Update documentation if required

## Key Design Decisions

- **Backward Compatibility:** Legacy combos remain accessible to everyone
- **No Model Changes:** Leveraging existing auth.signature
- **Gradual Transition:** New combos have creators, old ones stay shared
- **Minimal Frontend Impact:** Existing UI continues to work

## Database Query Patterns

```python
# Ownership filter pattern
ownership_filter = (db.billing_combo.created_by == auth.user_id) | (db.billing_combo.created_by == None)

# List user accessible combos
user_combos = db(ownership_filter & (db.billing_combo.is_active == True)).select()

# Check modification rights
can_modify = db((db.billing_combo.id == combo_id) & ownership_filter).count() > 0
```

## Implementation Context

- **Framework:** py4web with pyDAL
- **Authentication:** Built-in auth system with auth.user
- **Database:** Existing billing_combo table with auth.signature
- **Frontend:** JavaScript billing-combo-manager.js
