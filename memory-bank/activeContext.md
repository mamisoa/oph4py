# Active Context

## Current Focus and Priorities

The current focus is on implementing a modern Next.js 15 version of the worklist module alongside JavaScript code modernization in the existing py4web codebase. We're improving the quality and maintainability of the application by adopting modern frameworks and practices.

   - Create guidelines for implementing new API endpoints
   - Update user guides with new features

### API Transition Challenges and Solutions

During the migration to a modular API structure, we faced several challenges:

1. **Route Conflicts**:
   - Challenge: Importing both old and new endpoint implementations caused route registration conflicts in py4web
   - Solution: Commented out duplicate functions in rest.py while maintaining documentation and adding compatibility notices

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Challenge: After modularization, the BeID module failed due to missing smartcard package
   - Solution: Installed pyscard package in the py4web conda environment

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Challenge: Needed to maintain existing API functionality while transitioning to modular structure
   - Solution: Implemented a transitional approach where endpoints are migrated one by one with clear documentation

### Technical Context

The modular API structure follows this pattern:

```tree
api/
├── __init__.py             # Main package initialization
├── core/                   # Core functionality
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── policy.py           # API policies and permissions
│   ├── utils.py            # Utility functions
│   └── base.py             # Shared base functionality
├── endpoints/              # Individual API endpoints
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── auth.py             # User authentication endpoints
│   ├── email.py            # Email functionality
│   ├── upload.py           # File upload endpoints
│   ├── utils.py            # Utility endpoints (UUID, etc.)
│   ├── worklist.py         # Worklist operations
│   └── devices/            # Device-specific endpoints
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── beid.py         # Belgium eID card endpoints
└── models/                 # API-specific models
    └── __init__.py
```

The old `rest.py` file now includes a compatibility layer:

```python
# restAPI controllers
#
# COMPATIBILITY NOTICE:
# This file is being gradually migrated to a modular structure in the 'api/' directory.
# New code should be added to the appropriate modules in 'api/endpoints/'.
# This file is maintained for backward compatibility during the transition.

# Import the modular API endpoints
# This ensures the endpoints are registered with py4web
from .api import email, beid, endpoint_utils
```

## Previous Focus: Transaction Management

The project is currently focused on completing the stabilization of the transaction management system in the worklist module. We've been addressing issues with the transaction recovery UI and fixing serialization problems.

### Recent Changes (Last 48 Hours)

1. **Transaction Management System Fixes**
   - Fixed JSON serialization error in transaction details modal by enhancing datetime object handling
   - Improved transaction details viewer to handle various API response structures more reliably
   - Added debug information display for error transactions to help identify serialization issues
   - Updated Bootstrap 5 modal integration with proper data-bs-dismiss attribute for correct closing behavior
   - Enhanced patient name formatting in transaction details

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with transaction serialization fix details
   - Enhanced combo_fix_strategy.md with implementation challenges and solutions
   - Updated memory bank progress tracking with completed transaction viewer enhancements

### Next Steps (Short-term)

1. **Complete Transaction Recovery Testing**
   - Verify transaction recovery functionality across different browsers and scenarios
   - Test edge cases with various patient data and transaction types
   - Validate error handling for network outages during transaction processing

2. **Finalize Worklist UI Improvements**
   - Optimize transaction history display for mobile responsiveness
   - Enhance feedback messages for transaction operations
   - Add detailed tooltips for transaction status indicators

3. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed transaction recovery procedures to user documentation
   - Create technical documentation for the transaction system architecture

### Technical Context

Recent fixes have focused on addressing Python-specific serialization challenges:

```python
# Key issue fixed - datetime objects aren't directly JSON serializable
# Before: Objects like this would fail with "Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable"
audit_records = db(db.transaction_audit.transaction_id == transaction_id).select().as_list()

# After: Added explicit conversion of datetime objects to strings
for record in audit_records:
    for key, value in record.items():
        if isinstance(value, datetime.datetime):
            record[key] = value.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        elif isinstance(value, datetime.date):
            record[key] = value.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
```

## Next.js Worklist Conversion and JavaScript Code Modernization

### Current Focus

We are implementing a modern Next.js 15 version of the worklist module while continuing to modernize the JavaScript codebase.

```

### Prisma Schema

Our Prisma schema mirrors the existing database structure, with customizations to support Next.js patterns:

- All tables from the py4web application mapped to Prisma models
- Special attention to the `auth_user` table for authentication
- Relation mappings for complex data relationships

### Compatibility Considerations

- The Next.js application will initially run alongside the existing py4web application
- Both applications will share the same database
- Authentication will be managed through the existing system initially
- We'll implement a gradual transition strategy

## Current Project: Next.js Worklist Conversion (oph4js)

  - Added column sorting with proper visual indicators
  - Created comprehensive TypeScript typing with Prisma schema

### Next Tasks

- Implement UsersTable component
