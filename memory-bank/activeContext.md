# Project Archive: MD Summary Enhancement (COMPLETE)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE & ARCHIVED** - All phases implemented, including critical fixes and final UI polish. This document serves as a historical record of the project.

**Project**: Patient Consultation History Summary Implementation

- **Goal**: Display a patient's complete MD/GP consultation history in a dedicated summary view, replacing the previous content.
- **Scope**: The implementation included new patient-based API endpoints, a redesigned patient information card, a 7-column data table for consultation history, and a "View More" modal for complete history access.
- **Final Outcome**: A fully functional, visually refined patient summary page that correctly fetches and displays all required data, including patient photos and a detailed consultation history sourced from the correct database fields.

### üìã Implementation Phases & Key Decisions

#### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Backend API Development - COMPLETE + FIXED

**Location**: `api/endpoints/payment.py`
**Endpoints Implemented**:

-   `GET /api/patient/{patient_id}/md_summary[/{offset}]`: Paginated (5 per page) history.
-   `GET /api/patient/{patient_id}/md_summary_modal`: Full history (up to 50 records) for the modal.

**CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED**:

-   ‚úÖ **History Field Corrected**: The "History" column was correctly mapped to `current_hx.description` instead of the `phistory` table, ensuring data accuracy.
-   ‚úÖ **Patient-Centric Logic**: The API was designed to be patient-based, not worklist-based, which was a foundational requirement.

**Features Implemented**:

-   ‚úÖ Complex pyDAL `LEFT JOIN`s across `worklist`, `current_hx`, `ccx`, `followup`, `billing`, and `billing_codes` to aggregate all necessary information.
-   ‚úÖ On-the-fly aggregation of billing codes into a `"CODE1, CODE2 (‚Ç¨total)"` format.
-   ‚úÖ Robust error handling and logging.

#### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Frontend Template & JavaScript - COMPLETE + FIXED

**Location**:
-   Template: `templates/billing/summary.html`
-   JavaScript: `static/js/billing/summary-manager.js`

**CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED**:

-   ‚úÖ **Patient Data Loading**: The patient information bar was initially empty. `loadPatientInfo()` was implemented, but required further fixes.
-   ‚úÖ **API Call Format Corrected**: The API call to fetch user data was corrected from `/api/auth_user/{id}` to the proper query format: `/api/auth_user?id.eq={id}`.
-   ‚úÖ **Response Parsing Fixed**: The JS was updated to parse the patient object from `result.items[0]` instead of the incorrect `result.data`.
-   ‚úÖ **Field Mappings Corrected**: Fields like `dob`, `ssn`, and `idc_num` were correctly mapped from the API response.
-   ‚úÖ **Gender Handling Fixed**: Logic was added to handle numeric gender values (1=Male, 2=Female) for avatar selection.

#### ‚úÖ Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements & Photo Handling - COMPLETE

This phase focused on refining the UI based on user feedback for a polished, professional look.

-   ‚úÖ **Enhanced Patient Information Card**: A visually appealing, multi-column card replaced the simple patient bar. It includes a patient photo, calculated age, and other key details.
-   ‚úÖ **Base64 Photo Support**: The `loadPatientPhoto` function was updated to prioritize the `photob64` field from the API, allowing direct display of base64 images.
-   ‚úÖ **Photo Display Adjustments**:
    -   The `rounded-circle` class was removed to show the full, uncropped patient photo.
    -   A blue border around the photo was removed for a cleaner look.
-   ‚úÖ **Fallback Image Path Correction**:
    -   `404 Not Found` errors for fallback avatars were resolved by prepending the application's base URL to the SVG paths.
    -   Proactive (and failing) requests for non-existent `.jpg` and `.png` files were removed.
-   ‚úÖ **Final UI Cleanup**:
    -   A static green checkmark icon next to the photo was removed.
    -   The "Profile" and "New Visit" buttons were removed from the patient card, along with their corresponding event listeners, to simplify the interface as requested.

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema & UI/UX

**Tables Involved**: `worklist`, `current_hx`, `ccx`, `followup`, `billing`, `billing_codes`, `procedure`, `modality`.

**UI/UX Design**:
-   **Patient Card**: A professional, card-based layout with a 4-column responsive grid.
-   **Main Table**: A 7-column Bootstrap table with responsive column widths and text truncation for long content.
-   **Modal**: A large (`modal-xl`) Bootstrap modal with a sticky header for displaying the complete consultation history.
