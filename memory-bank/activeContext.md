# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently focused on enhancing user experience and email functionality in the application. Recent work includes:

1. Email Functionality Enhancement
   - Added editable email fields to prescription and certificate modals
   - Improved email customization options
   - Enhanced user feedback for email operations
   - Maintained consistent behavior across all modals

2. User Interface Improvements
   - Pre-populated email fields with patient data
   - Added client-side email validation
   - Improved error handling and user notifications
   - Maintained consistent UI patterns across modals

## Current Focus: Worklist Combo Issue

### Issue Description

When adding a worklist with a combo (multiple worklist items), sometimes one of the items is incorrectly added to an existing worklist from another patient, causing data corruption.

### Root Causes Identified

1. Lack of proper transaction handling for combo additions
2. Race conditions in async operations
3. Insufficient validation of patient-item relationships
4. Global state management issues
5. No proper error handling and rollback mechanisms

### Implementation Progress

#### Phase 1: Frontend-Only Solution (COMPLETED)

The first phase of the solution has been successfully implemented:

1. **State Management**
   - Implemented `WorklistStateManager` class for tracking item state
   - Added uniqueId generation for reliable item tracking
   - Implemented patient consistency validation

2. **Request Queue System**
   - Implemented a `RequestQueue` class to prevent race conditions
   - Added sequential processing of requests
   - Provided consistent error handling

3. **UI Protection**
   - Created a `UIManager` for UI state handling
   - Added loading indicators during processing
   - Implemented button locking during operations

4. **Worklist Core Logic Updates**
   - Updated worklist JavaScript to use the state manager
   - Replaced global variables with structured state
   - Added data cleansing and validation

#### Phase 2: Backend Enhancements (COMPLETED)

1. **Step 1: API Enhancements (COMPLETED)**
   - Created a batch API endpoint in `rest.py` for atomic operations
   - Implemented database transaction handling for batch operations
   - Added error management with rollback functionality
   - Implemented proper validation for batch operations
   - Designed response structure for transaction status

2. **Step 2: Database and Frontend Integration (COMPLETED)**
   - Added transaction_id field to worklist table
   - Created transaction_audit table for operation tracking
   - Implemented transaction status monitoring with complete/failed/partial states
   - Added recovery mechanisms for failed transactions
   - Created transaction history UI with detailed inspection
   - Added client-side transaction tracking in localStorage
   - Fixed duplicate field issues with auth.signature integration
   - Enhanced error reporting with detailed status tracking
   - Implemented user-friendly transaction recovery UI

### Proposed Solutions

#### 1. Transaction Support (IMPLEMENTED)

- Implemented transaction wrapper for combo additions
- Added rollback mechanism for failed operations
- Ensured atomic operations for multi-item additions
- Added transaction history and tracking

#### 2. Data Validation (IMPLEMENTED)

- Added comprehensive validation for worklist items
- Validated patient-item relationships
- Implemented pre-submission checks
- Added batch validation on server side

#### 3. State Management (IMPLEMENTED)

- Created WorklistStateManager class for better state control
- Tracked pending and processing items
- Prevented concurrent operations for same patient
- Implemented transaction tracking

#### 4. Error Handling (IMPLEMENTED)

- Added try-catch blocks in critical sections
- Implemented proper error reporting
- Added validation error messages
- Created transaction status tracking

#### 5. UI Synchronization (IMPLEMENTED)

- Improved form state management
- Added loading states
- Ensured proper table refresh timing
- Created transaction recovery UI

#### 6. Locking Mechanism (IMPLEMENTED)

- Implemented patient-level locks during combo processing
- Added timeout mechanisms
- Handled lock release properly
- Created transaction boundary enforcement

## Recent Changes

- Completed Phase 2 Step 2 of worklist combo fix with transaction management
- Added transaction_id field to worklist table for batch tracking
- Created transaction_audit table for comprehensive monitoring
- Implemented transaction recovery UI with inspection capabilities
- Fixed duplicate field issues with auth.signature integration
- Enhanced error reporting with transaction status tracking
- Added client-side transaction history in localStorage

## Next Steps

1. Worklist Combo Fix:
   - Monitor the transaction system in production
   - Gather metrics on transaction success rates
   - Analyze performance of batch operations
   - Consider further optimizations for high-volume scenarios
   - Document the transaction system for maintenance

2. Continue monitoring and improving email functionality:
   - Gather user feedback on the new email customization feature
   - Monitor email delivery success rates
   - Consider adding email templates for different types of communications
   - Implement email tracking if needed

3. User Interface Refinements:
   - Consider adding email history or tracking
   - Evaluate need for additional email customization options
   - Monitor user interaction with email features
   - Consider adding email preview functionality

## Active Decisions

1. Email Functionality
   - Using editable email fields in all relevant modals
   - Pre-populating with patient email by default
   - Implementing consistent validation across all forms
   - Providing clear user feedback for all operations

2. User Interface Patterns
   - Maintaining consistent modal layouts
   - Using standard Bootstrap form components
   - Implementing clear validation feedback
   - Following established notification patterns

## Current Status

- Email functionality improvements are complete
- User interface is consistent across all modals
- All changes are tracked in CHANGELOG.md
- Following established patterns for form handling and validation
