## Current Focus and Priorities

The current focus is on completing the stabilization of the transaction management system in the worklist module. We've been addressing issues with the transaction recovery UI and fixing serialization problems.

### Recent Changes (Last 48 Hours)

1. **Transaction Management System Fixes**
   - Fixed JSON serialization error in transaction details modal by enhancing datetime object handling
   - Improved transaction details viewer to handle various API response structures more reliably
   - Added debug information display for error transactions to help identify serialization issues
   - Updated Bootstrap 5 modal integration with proper data-bs-dismiss attribute for correct closing behavior
   - Enhanced patient name formatting in transaction details

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with transaction serialization fix details
   - Enhanced combo_fix_strategy.md with implementation challenges and solutions
   - Updated memory bank progress tracking with completed transaction viewer enhancements

### Next Steps (Short-term)

1. **Complete Transaction Recovery Testing**
   - Verify transaction recovery functionality across different browsers and scenarios
   - Test edge cases with various patient data and transaction types
   - Validate error handling for network outages during transaction processing

2. **Finalize Worklist UI Improvements**
   - Optimize transaction history display for mobile responsiveness
   - Enhance feedback messages for transaction operations
   - Add detailed tooltips for transaction status indicators

3. **Documentation**
   - Add detailed transaction recovery procedures to user documentation
   - Create technical documentation for the transaction system architecture

### Technical Context

Recent fixes have focused on addressing Python-specific serialization challenges:

```python
# Key issue fixed - datetime objects aren't directly JSON serializable
# Before: Objects like this would fail with "Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable"
audit_records = db(db.transaction_audit.transaction_id == transaction_id).select().as_list()

# After: Added explicit conversion of datetime objects to strings
for record in audit_records:
    for key, value in record.items():
        if isinstance(value, datetime.datetime):
            record[key] = value.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        elif isinstance(value, datetime.date):
            record[key] = value.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
```

These changes ensure that all Python datetime objects are properly converted to string format before JSON serialization occurs, allowing the transaction details to be correctly displayed in the UI.

## Current Focus

The project is currently focused on enhancing user experience and email functionality in the application. Recent work includes:

1. Email Functionality Enhancement
   - Added editable email fields to prescription and certificate modals
   - Improved email customization options
   - Enhanced user feedback for email operations
   - Maintained consistent behavior across all modals

2. User Interface Improvements
   - Pre-populated email fields with patient data
   - Added client-side email validation
   - Improved error handling and user notifications
   - Maintained consistent UI patterns across modals

## Current Focus: Worklist Combo Issue

### Issue Description

When adding a worklist with a combo (multiple worklist items), sometimes one of the items is incorrectly added to an existing worklist from another patient, causing data corruption.

### Root Causes Identified

1. Lack of proper transaction handling for combo additions
2. Race conditions in async operations
3. Insufficient validation of patient-item relationships
4. Global state management issues
5. No proper error handling and rollback mechanisms

### Implementation Progress

#### Phase 1: Frontend-Only Solution (COMPLETED)

The first phase of the solution has been successfully implemented:

1. **State Management**
   - Implemented `WorklistStateManager` class for tracking item state
   - Added uniqueId generation for reliable item tracking
   - Implemented patient consistency validation

2. **Request Queue System**
   - Implemented a `RequestQueue` class to prevent race conditions
   - Added sequential processing of requests
   - Provided consistent error handling

3. **UI Protection**
   - Created a `UIManager` for UI state handling
   - Added loading indicators during processing
   - Implemented button locking during operations

4. **Worklist Core Logic Updates**
   - Updated worklist JavaScript to use the state manager
   - Replaced global variables with structured state
   - Added data cleansing and validation

#### Phase 2: Backend Enhancements (COMPLETED)

1. **Step 1: API Enhancements (COMPLETED)**
   - Created a batch API endpoint in `rest.py` for atomic operations
   - Implemented database transaction handling for batch operations
   - Added error management with rollback functionality
   - Implemented proper validation for batch operations
   - Designed response structure for transaction status

2. **Step 2: Database and Frontend Integration (COMPLETED)**
   - Added transaction_id field to worklist table
   - Created transaction_audit table for operation tracking
   - Implemented transaction status monitoring with complete/failed/partial states
   - Added recovery mechanisms for failed transactions
   - Created transaction history UI with detailed inspection
   - Added client-side transaction tracking in localStorage
   - Fixed duplicate field issues with auth.signature integration
   - Enhanced error reporting with detailed status tracking
   - Implemented user-friendly transaction recovery UI

### Proposed Solutions

#### 1. Transaction Support (IMPLEMENTED)

- Implemented transaction wrapper for combo additions
- Added rollback mechanism for failed operations
- Ensured atomic operations for multi-item additions
- Added transaction history and tracking

#### 2. Data Validation (IMPLEMENTED)

- Added comprehensive validation for worklist items
- Validated patient-item relationships
- Implemented pre-submission checks
- Added batch validation on server side

#### 3. State Management (IMPLEMENTED)

- Created WorklistStateManager class for better state control
- Tracked pending and processing items
- Prevented concurrent operations for same patient
- Implemented transaction tracking

#### 4. Error Handling (IMPLEMENTED)

- Added try-catch blocks in critical sections
- Implemented proper error reporting
- Added validation error messages
- Created transaction status tracking

#### 5. UI Synchronization (IMPLEMENTED)

- Improved form state management
- Added loading states
- Ensured proper table refresh timing
- Created transaction recovery UI

#### 6. Locking Mechanism (IMPLEMENTED)

- Implemented patient-level locks during combo processing
- Added timeout mechanisms
- Handled lock release properly
- Created transaction boundary enforcement

## Recent Changes

## Next Steps

1. Worklist Combo Fix:
   - Monitor the transaction system in production
   - Gather metrics on transaction success rates
   - Analyze performance of batch operations
   - Consider further optimizations for high-volume scenarios
   - Document the transaction system for maintenance

2. Continue monitoring and improving email functionality:
   - Gather user feedback on the new email customization feature
   - Monitor email delivery success rates
   - Consider adding email templates for different types of communications
   - Implement email tracking if needed

3. User Interface Refinements:
