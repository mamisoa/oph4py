# Active Context

## Current Focus and Priorities

**üéâ BILLING MODULE FULLY OPERATIONAL (2025-06-01T23:01:05.299685)**

All critical issues in the billing combo management system have been completely resolved.

### Issue Resolution Status: ALL RESOLVED ‚úÖ

**‚úÖ RESOLVED: PyDAL RestAPI Invalid Fields Error**

- **Issue**: POST/PUT requests to billing combo API failed with "Invalid fields: ['is_active']" error
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript was sending `is_active` field in form submissions, but PyDAL RestAPI rejected it as invalid
- **Solution**: Removed all `is_active` field references from frontend code (JavaScript and template)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Billing combo creation and editing now work correctly

**‚úÖ RESOLVED: Authentication Status Display**

- **Issue**: Billing combo management page showed "Not logged" instead of user email
- **Root Cause**: Missing `user = auth.get_user()` in `billing_combo()` controller
- **Solution**: Added proper user context assignment in controller
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Navigation now displays user email and dropdown correctly

**‚úÖ RESOLVED: Specialty Dropdown Default Selection**

- **Root Cause**: HTML string generation in controller was unreliable for setting selected attributes
- **Solution**: Replaced controller HTML generation with structured data and template loops

## Previous Issues (RESOLVED) ‚úÖ

**‚úÖ RESOLVED: PyDAL RestAPI Error (2025-06-01T23:01:05.299685)**

**‚úÖ RESOLVED: Billing Module Enhancements (2025-06-01T21:24:12.693251)**

All billing module core functionality issues have been resolved.

### Previous Failed Attempts (Now Superseded) ‚ùå

The following 6 attempts failed because they tried to work around the fundamental issue instead of addressing the root cause:

1. ‚ùå Controller-level selected attribute (HTML string approach)
2. ‚ùå Template placeholder removal
3. ‚ùå JavaScript form reset fixes
4. ‚ùå JavaScript failsafe mechanisms
5. ‚ùå Enhanced JavaScript with setTimeout
6. ‚ùå HTML structure cleanup

**Root Cause Identified**: All previous attempts used HTML string generation in the controller, which is unreliable for setting selected attributes across different browser contexts.
