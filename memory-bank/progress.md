## Current Status

### Stability

- ✅ Core functionality stable
- ✅ Email system operational
- ✅ UI components functional
- ✅ API modularization complete
- 🔄 Ongoing JavaScript modernization

### Known Issues

1. **Email System**
   - PDF size limitations
   - Attachment handling edge cases
   - Email delivery monitoring

2. **UI/UX**
   - Form validation edge cases
   - Modal interaction timing
   - Browser compatibility issues

3. **Performance**
   - PDF generation speed
   - Large dataset handling
   - Client-side resource usage

4. **API Issues: Fixed**
   - PUT request validation error with crudp function (FIXED)
     - Issue: PUT requests failed with "Validation Error: invalid id" when ID was in both URL and payload
     - Fix: Enhanced crudp function to properly handle REST API expectations:
       - Extract ID from data payload when id parameter is "0"
       - Remove ID from request payload to prevent validation conflicts
       - Set API URL with ID in the path for PUT requests
     - This fix resolves common error patterns in CCX, worklist, and user forms
