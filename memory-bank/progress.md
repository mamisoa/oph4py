2. **UI/UX**
   - Form validation edge cases
   - Modal interaction timing
   - Browser compatibility issues

3. **Performance**
   - PDF generation speed
   - Large dataset handling
   - Client-side resource usage

4. **API Issues: Fixed**
   - PUT request validation error with crudp function (FIXED)
